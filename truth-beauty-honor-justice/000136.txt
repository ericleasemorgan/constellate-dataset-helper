Chapter 8 &< 1 88 1 - 1 888 Return to the Department of Entomology at Cornell EARLY in August, 1 88 1 , we returned to Ithaca and began the work of settling the laboratory and our home. Housecleaning and paper hanging added to the confusion of our homecoming. It had been decided that Cousin Helen Willits should come with us to Ithaca and pursue her studies in the University. She was to have charge of the house in order that I might have time to finish my drawings for Mr. Comstock's coccid report. In addition to all of his other work, Harry enthusiastically planted a straw­ berry bed and set out raspberry and currant bushes, all with his own hands, at odd moments. He bought a carpenter's bench and tools, which he installed in the cellar; this acquisition helped us in many an hour of need. That fall he made a herbarium for Helen which stands staunch and strong in our cellar today. I wrote my mother : "The only drawback to Harry's happiness, while at his carpenter work, is lack of company. Usually, on some pretext or other, he inveigles either Helen or me to go down there with him. I think if he could have his carpenter bench in the parlor, he would be entirely happy." We hired a maid, fresh from the bogs of Ireland, ruddy as to cheeks and blue as to eyes and with the single accomplishment of being able to wash windows. With Helen's patient training, Katie developed into a capable, efficient maid, loyal and willing. One summer day, Katie, pale with fright, rushed into the parlor where I was receiving callers and cried, "Ooch l Koom in the kitchen, the divil is on the doorpost." I hurried out to find a 1 37 THE COMSTOCKS OF CORNELL large adult dobson, Corydalus cornutus/ on the doorcasing, snapping his great curved jaws angrily. I did not wonder at Katie's characterization of this creature. In September, 1 8 8 1 , President Garfield died, and on the twenty-eighth President White pronounced an eloquent memo­ rial address in our University chapel, decorated with flowers for the occasion. Soon another sad event occurred-the death of Jennie McGraw Fiske, donor of the Cornell chimes. She and her husband, Cornell's Librarian, Professor Willard Fiske, had come from Europe, expecting to take possession of a beautiful home which was nearly completed, the notable "Fiske McGraw Man­ sion" on the site of the present Chi Psi Lodge. She never saw the house finished, but her funeral was held there. We entered wholeheartedly into the University life. We were glad when President White added to our Cornell faculty Pro­ fessor Moses Coit Tyler, author of A History of A merican Liter­ ature. Harry and I attended his first course of lectures. We went regularly to Cornell's Sage Chapel and rejoiced in the privilege of hearing the great preachers who came to Cornell-Phillips Brooks, Lyman Abbott, and others. In 1 8 8 1 , the eminent English historian, Edward A. Freeman, gave lectures at Cornell which we attended . Unforgettable were his appearance and method of lecturing. He was stout and had an immense beard which gave him a patriarchal appearance. He was a victim of gout and delivered his lectures sitting, with one foot encased in an immense slipper and elevated on a footrest in front of him. He read his lectures from a manuscript with the inflection of a country schoolboy who lets his voice slide down at every period. President White, who had been American Minister to Ger­ many from 1 879 until 1 88 1 , returned this fall and we were happy to have him back at Cornell. He and Mrs. White were neighborly and often called on us. On one occasion I was interested to hear Mr. White's private opinion of President Garfield. He said that Garfield had been a strong man, but no upholder of the civil 1 An aquatic insect with a wing-expanse of four to five inches; the male has long curved mandibles.-G.W.H. 138 188 1-1888 service, and related some shocking stories of the manner in which able, efficient United States consuls had been replaced by inex­ perienced politicians. He maintained that, although people had the idea that Garfield was a reformer, he had begun his adminis­ tration as badly as any President in history; and he believed there had been less hope for governmental reform from Garfield than from his successor, President Arthur. That fall my father and mother came to visit us for the first time in our Ithaca home. They found much to interest them. Father was especially interested in the University farm and the stock, and during his visit he bought two Holstein cows to add to the value of his own herd. A momentous event occurred just before the opening of the University in the fall of 1 88 1 . The entomological laboratory in the tower of McGraw Hall had become so crowded that it could not accommodate the students and Mr. Comstock was given a new laboratory on the second floor of White Hall at the north end, with a small office adjoining, and an assistant so that Harry could find time for his government work. The new laboratory seemed palatial, and yet, as the years passed, more room was needed until the whole north section of this second floor was given over to entomology. In November, 1 88 1 , the University raised the salaries of assist­ ant professors from $ 1 ,000 to $ 1 ,200, and we paid $200 on the mortgage of our house, reducing it to $goo. About this time Mr. Comstock began seriously to write a textbook for his classes, al­ though he still had much to do on the coccid report. He took a lamp to the laboratory and worked there nights. A telephone had been installed in the laboratory so that I could reach him if necessary, and this seemed a great luxury. It is now hard to realize the difficulties we were experiencing in 1 88 1 in the mere matter of daily living. We had no mail delivery and were obliged to go to the Ithaca post office on foot or in an omnibus to get mail. As Mr. Gage was soon to be married to Susanna Phelps, he did not again take a room in our house; but he came to us for his meals and, as ever, added greatly to the family cheer. In 1 88 1 he 1 39 THE COMSTOCKS OF CORNELL was working with Dr. Burt G. Wilder on the "cat book," a labo­ ratory manual for the dissection of the cat. Dr. Wilder had intro­ duced a new nomenclature in describing the relations of ana­ tomical parts to each other, and in a measure this appealed to Mr. Comstock. The discussions between Gage and Harry were characteristic. They would argue excitedly and pound the table for emphasis, until my gentle cousin Helen was frightened, fear­ ing that they might quarrel. But every discussion ended suddenly in the complete yielding of one or the other, with "Well, I think you are right, Brother Gage," or "I think you are right, Brother Comstock." When his approaching marriage was discussed, Professor Gage showed signs of nervousness. He feared that the Episcopal cere­ mony would be a long, trying rite. He confided his fears to Harry, who hunted up the Prayer Book and with great gravity began to read to him the visitation of the sick, doing a little judicious skipping. Gage's face grew more and more serious until finally he began to suspect something wrong, and took the book to see for himself, at which Mr. Comstock and I laughed until we wept. We went to Morrisville, New York, for the wedding, in the Phelps home, the house which now contains the village library, a gift from Mrs. Gage to her native town. It was a beautiful wedding, and the dear twain, made one, were soon in Ithaca, where the four of us, now joined in double bonds, began anew an intimate friendship which lasted for more than thirty years. An important improvement in the entomological laboratory was a new cabinet of white ash which Mr. Comstock had had built for the insect collection. It was about seventeen feet long, nine feet high, and deep enough to hold insect boxes two feet square ; it had eight sections for the boxes, each of which could be pulled out like a drawer. Mr. Comstock had put much thought on the best means of building up a collection of insects. One problem was that of adding acquired specimens to the collection, which often meant the repinning of a whole box of insects in order to insert the additions in the right places. To meet this problem, he devised a system on the plan of a card catalogue, using blocks of cork, later of wood, in multiples to fit the box. 140 188 1-1888 This system enabled him to make new entries by shifting the blocks. It also gave opportunity for making the boxes tighter and more nearly pest-proof, for · the bottom and the top of each box could be made of a single pane of glass. Another problem con­ nected with the insect collection was to find a way of preventing the loss of alcohol from straight vials containing specimens, when laid flat on the blocks. This difficulty was met eventually by devising a quadrangular vial with the neck bent sharply up­ ward. This form of bottle became known in the laboratory as the bent-neck vial. Mr. Comstock possessed considerable mechanical skill, and when he gave his thought to this type of problem the result was usually effective and practical . Mr. Comstock's influence as a teacher was growing steadily. The outline for the study of a grasshopper, which he had written for his own use in his laboratory, as an introduction to insect anatomy, was adopted, in the spring of 1 882 for the entomologi­ cal laboratories of the Universities of Iowa and Wisconsin. During this year Cornell had two notable nonresident lectur­ ers from Ann Arbor : Charles Kendall Adams, who lectured on English history, and Henry Carter Adams, who gave a course on the tariff, especially the tariffs of England and America. We at­ tended these courses of lectures and became well acquainted with both men, never dreaming that Charles Kendall Adams would be the next President of Cornell and our nearest neighbor for years . The number of students at Cornell was small in the academic year of 1 8 8 1 - 1 8 8 2 . Mr. Comstock had only twenty in his lectures and ten in his laboratory, the smallest classes he ever had. His lecture class increased to thirty before the term was far advanced. During the spring he and Cousin Helen continued their botani­ cal collecting. I went with them on their excursions and for the first time undertook to sketch in water color. On June 2 8, we finished the report on injurious insects for the Department of Agriculture 2 and sent it to Washington, know- 2 Report of the Entomologist of the United States Department of Agriculture for the Year i88o, by John Henry Comstock, 1 88 1 . This report contains the notable work on the Coccidae by which Professor Comstock established for the first time THE COMSTOCKS OF CORNELL ing th.at this would be the end of Mr. Comstock's official connec­ tion with the Department, despite Commissioner Loring's prom­ ises of future work. Harry had utilized every possible moment in writing this report, and I had worked every day on the drawings. While the report discussed some insects of economic importance, aside from the scale insects, more than 1 00 pages were devoted to the Coccidae. We were proud of this report at the time, and we would have been even more so, had we known that it would be­ come the basis of all future work on this important family of in­ sects . The part of the report that was devoted to the parasites was written by L. 0. Howard and included many of my drawings of the chalcids. After Commencement at Cornell, we went to Otto and re­ mained there until August, when we went to the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, at Mon­ treal. On our way we stopped at Oswego where we visited all branches of the Turner family. I was especially interested in our visit with Captain Turner, Mr. Comstock's "Pa Lewis," whom I had never seen. He was a large, fine-looking man with white hair and a ruddy face; he talked in tones of thunder. He had once been very profane but had become a "professor of religion" ; Harry said that his way of saying "God bless him" was very reminiscent of his former "God damn him." Captain Turner was so excited and happy over our arrival that at dinner he forgot to say grace until after he had begun to eat; suddenly he raised his hand and thundered : "Hold up, and we will ask the blessing of God." I wanted to laugh, but when I saw my husband drop his fork and bow his head, as calmly as if this were the usual method of procedure, I suppressed my smile. I enjoyed the com­ pany of Pa Lewis greatly and have always been glad that we made this visit, for I never saw him again. We took a long drive while at Oswego, visiting all of the schools where Harry had been a a simple, accurate basis for the classification of the species of scale insects in the important family Diaspidinae. The work was based on the characters of the pygidia (posterior segments of the body) drawn by Mrs. Comstock from the actual specimens and illustrated in the report by many fine plates. The article by Dr. Howard on the parasites of the Coccidae established his reputation at this early time as an authority in the field of insect parasitism.-G.W.H. 1881-1888 pupil and the schoolhouse where he had taught, and calling on many of his friends. The American Association for the Advancement of Science was in its youth and the novelty of holding the meeting in Canada was a special inducement to attend. Montreal was most hospitable to its scientific guests and the meetings were success­ ful and enjoyable. Mr. Comstock read a paper before the Agri­ cultural section and C. V. Riley, who was present, attacked him quite rudely. My husband kept his temper and answered in a few quiet words that made controversy impossible. Later, several of the entomologists congratulated him on his manner of dealing with the matter. On our return trip we visited Quebec, the White Mountains, and Boston, to see its many historic buildings and monuments. From Boston we journeyed to Orono, Maine, to visit Professor and Mrs. C. H. Fernald of the State University of Maine, which then had four dignified buildings on an attractive campus and a faculty of about twelve professors and instructors. On our re­ turn to Boston we went to Cambridge to visit Dr. and Mrs. H. A. Hagen. They took us for an extended drive around Cambridge and Brookline, Massachusetts . Dr. Hagen always seemed to con­ sider Mr. Comstock his chief disciple in America. When we were discussing the difficult servant problem in America, Mrs. Hagen told me of a nobleman from Europe who had visited them. Mrs. Hagen had no regular servant but was able to get a woman to come in to cook and wait on the table while she attended to the other housework. On the Baron's departure, he said to his hostess : "I have tried in vain to see the maid who has kept my room in such good order, but I have been unable to find her. I have left something for her on my bureau." Mrs. Hagen said, laughing, "I thanked him and I think I enjoyed spending that $2 .50 more than any other money I have ever spent." Momentous decisions were made this autumn. I determined to go back into the University, take the course in science which my husband had taken, and get my Cornell degree. Mr. Com­ stock thought I should have more training and knowledge in the sciences allied to entomology, and that I would be better satis- 143 THE COMSTOCKS OF CORNELL fied to have a degree. I was allowed the same privilege of free tuition that was granted later to children of professors. Thus I could register for a minimum number of hours, which would allow time for my other work. We had also come to the conclu­ sion that I must learn wood engraving to illustrate An Introduc­ tion to Entomology which Mr. Comstock was to write as soon as possible. I saw an advertisement of wood engraving tools, with a booklet of directions, and promptly sent for them; and with my usual daring on untried paths I went at it. That autumn the trustees raised the salaries of the professors $250. We were delighted that Professor Gage's salary was in­ creased from $ 1 ,000 to $ 1 ,500. President White went with Dr. Burt G. Wilder and Mr. Comstock to Ward's Natural Science Establishment in Rochester. The President became enthusiastic over the beautiful models of invertebrates, made in glass by the Blaschkes of Austria, and saw new possibilities for the depart­ ment of invertebrate zoology at Cornell, and as a result, the ap­ propriation for running the laboratory was raised from $50 a year to $675. Besides that, Mr. Comstock received $ 1 ,200 with which to buy a set of the glass models to illustrate his lectures, and $300 for the purchase of museum specimens of invertebrates. He was delighted and encouraged. He engaged a student assist­ ant and thus was relieved of much drudgery. Harry kept his assistant busy at odd moments in pinning and mounting speci­ mens, thus adding many new boxes of insects to the University's collection. After a long period of waiting, all of these changes constituted one of those unexpected leaps forward that have char­ acterized the growth of the Department of Entomology at Cor­ nell. During this period running water was brought into the laboratory and Mr. Comstock established a series of glass jar aquaria which enabled him to show his students aquatic insects in their natural element. President White went with Mr. Comstock to Rochester to select and buy the glass models. As they did not spend all of the appropriation for the models, they purchased needed specimens of insects . On the way back from Rochester, President White sat with Harry and authorized him to inquire from leading ento- 144 188 1-1 888 mologists what collections were for sale, and promised that he would get the money for their purchase as fast as possible. Harry was greatly encouraged and confided to me that he expected to build up the third best collection in America, for he could hardly expect to overtake the Cambridge and Philadelphia museums. Harry's idea, consistently carried out, was to limit the · Cornell collections to North American insects. A considerable part of the Report on Scale Insects, which Mr. Comstock had prepared for the United States Department of Agriculture, was left out of the annual report by Commissioner Loring. The reason given was lack of space. The Cornell Experi­ ment Station proposed to publish the omitted part as a bulletin. As some of the illustrations were outline figures on wood, I was asked to engrave them and was given $5o for the work. I had been practicing with my shallow tools that were later character­ ized by my teacher, Mr. Davis, as "very curious." But I managed to engrave those complicated outlines and did a fairly good job, meanwhile getting "loads of experience." I lamed the muscles of my arm in the process, something that would have seemed ludicrous to a skilled engraver. I took an added responsibility when on November 4, 1 882 , I joined the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, the first sorority estab­ lished at Cornell. Many of us would have preferred that none should come to our University. However, this one was estab­ lished and others were sure to follow. I was too democratic and too catholic in my tastes to be in sympathy with any organization that was exclusive, and I had little use for secret societies of any kind. I consulted President White and he advised me strongly to join this first sorority, because, he said, I "might have a wise influence within it and also upon the relations of the sororities to each other, when others should be established." Membership in the sorority has brought me many fine, happy friendships and has enriched my life by the close companionship of noble women. Through Kappa Alpha Theta I have been closely and constantly associated with a group of women students during forty-eight years . It has brought me a great deal of extra work and care and has sometimes caused me mental anguish, for it has 1 45 THE COMSTOCKS OF CORNELL been in some measure a barrier between me and other students, a source of much regret to me. I have seen both boys and girls develop splendidly under the spur and responsibilities of frater­ nity life, and I have seen others ruined through it. I believe it would be better for colleges and universities if the social life were to center in clubs which have their inception in some spe­ cial interest or activity, rather than in fraternities, where the membership is restricted to personal choice or caprice, and which are, at their best, a menace to the democracy of an American in­ stitution of learning. With all due modesty, I think I may say that I have exerted an influence that has been felt in three direc­ tions : the maintenance of friendly relations between the sorori­ ties, the widening of the sympathies and interests of my sorority sisters, and the impressing, upon the members of my chapter, of a sense of their responsibilities to their sisters and to the Uni­ versity. I was never a good nurse but I was a good doctor. Mr. Com­ stock came home from a meeting of the Western New York Horticultural Society, in Rochester, with a terrifying cold. I gave him a "hemlock sweat," a remedy employed by my New England ancestors. It broke up his cold but after it he was weak for days. Later, he had lumbago and the doctor told me to paint his back with iodine. His back was so white and smooth that, as I dipped my brush in the colorful liquid, my artistic instincts were aroused and I painted a lake, with a forest on the far side, reflected in the still waters. I did not dare tell the patient what I had done, but the doctor enjoyed telling Harry of the beautiful outcome of his lumbago. In 1 882 , Dr. E. L. Sturtevant, the head of the State Experi­ ment Station at Geneva, paid Mr. Comstock one hundred dollars a year and his traveling expenses to do entomological work for the station; and Dr. Samuel H. Scudder, planning to start a scien­ tific periodical, asked Harry to become a regular contributor, which meant a further addition to his income. While Mr. Comstock never called the roll in his college classes, he kept in touch with his students through weekly quizzes, and this term he looked over fifty examination papers every week. 146 1 88 1-1888 Three of the faculty wives attended his classes and he felt much complimented. The glass models added to the interest of his work. In the first term, when Harry's work was entirely on ento­ mology, we entertained the whole class one evening at our home. We also did other entertaining of the women of my sorority and of the men of Harry's fraternity. It seemed best for us that I finish my university course as soon as possible, so we gave up housekeeping and took our meals at Sage College. This brought us into rather close association with many of the women students and resulted in much more gaiety on our part than we had anticipated. I registered for the largest possible number of hours and Mr. Comstock took the course in physics with me; if any of the in­ structors in that department had been as good a$ he, in explain­ ing to me the mysteries of that science, the class would have had an easier time. Several of the women in the class used to come to our house to get the benefit of Mr. Comstock's explanations. He could always make the most abstruse subject clear, a faculty contributing greatly to his power as a teacher. After Commencement I went to Otto, but Mr. Comstock re­ mained at home because he had much to do for his department and was. also writing the article on Hymenoptera 3 for the Standard Natural History . He lived at home and took his meals at a boarding house on Eddy Street. Professor William R. Dud­ ley 4 also ate there and the two had delightful collecting excur­ sions together. An undergraduate was working for the depart­ ment and Mr. Comstock was teaching him to collect and care for living insects in breeding cages in the laboratory. Harry wrote me : "I tried today for the twe11tieth time to impress upon him that I want all data respecting insects saved. I like him very a Hymenoptera, an order of insects with four clear, membranous wings, familiar examples of which are the bees, wasps, and ants.-G.W.H. 4 Dudley was a Cornell graduate who, with David Starr Jordan, explored the flora of the Cayuga Lake region. A leader in the conservation of plants in New York and in California, Dudley led in the conservation movement for the preserva­ tion of the giant redwoods, Sequoia gigantae, and Sequoia semper virens, and of other trees, shrubs, and flowers, while a Professor of Botany at Stanford Uni­ versity.-R.G.S. 147 THE COMSTOCKS OF CORNELL much, but he is a very, very young boy and I have to watch every step of his work." My husband described his day's work : "I work on the Hymenoptera article all of the mornings. After­ noons I have to go over the notes and the breeding cages and attend to my correspondence. I have found a caterpillar in the seeds of currants that seems very important. It causes the fruit to shrivel and is quite common here." This was the first year of an important change in the Ento­ mological Department at Cornell. Mr. Comstock was to remain in Ithaca and work during the summer and have a three months' vacation in winter. He had proposed this because it seemed to him the only way in which he could develop his collections and assemble data concerning injurious insects. He had no thought then of establishing the summer school in entomology; that came years later. Unfortunately for his plans, I fell ill of fever at Otto and he came on at once. There was no nurse to be had in that country village, and as my mother was not well, Harry nursed me through nine weeks of low fever. He was an excellent nurse and was a great comfort to me, because of the telepathy that had always existed between us and which now reached an amazing perfection. All I had to do was to wish for something and he responded immediately, relieving me of the effort of speaking. It was a discouraging summer, but by the end of Sep­ tember I was well enough to return with hiin to Ithaca, a shadow of my former self. The parlor of our little house was filled with flowers from friends when we arrived. Mr. Comstock had finished the first part of the Hymenoptera article before he had left Ithaca. He worked on the second part at odd moments while he was nursing me. I remember that he worked out the history of the little carpenter bee, Eumenes fraternus, by bringing in the stems of sumac and raspberry and entertaining me with the story as fa.st as he was able to decipher it. That is why in my book, Ways of the Six-Footed, I entitled this chapter "The Story We Love Best." That fall Harry joined a Republican revolt against Blaine and brought all of his influence to bear in favor of the election of Grover Cleveland to the presidency of the United States. From 1 48 1881-1 888 one of the enemy political meetings which he attended he did not get home until I A.M., and he was in bed with a sick headache the next day. I cheered him up by telling him that nowadays men did not often have a chance to suffer for their country. As my strength returned, my hair fell out-the thick, black hair which had been my chief claim to beauty. But I had to have it cut off, and, as usual, I spent no time mourning over what could not be helped. Bobbed hair was unheard of in those days and I had to become resigned to appearing different from other women. I wore my hair short for two or three years because I found it convenient and time saving. Then Harry announced one day: "My dear, one member of our family must have long hair; shall it be you or I?" I took the hint and let my hair grow again. In those days, students at Cornell had to write theses for the de­ grees of B.A. and B.S . I wrote mine with Professor Gage, on "The Fine Anatomy of the Interior of the Larva of Corydalus cor­ nutus." The work was most interesting: I imbedded tissues and cut sections and wondered at the beautiful structure of this horrible-looking creature's insides . I told Professor Gage that a dobson (a larva of Corydalus) was like a stained-glass window; it could only be appreciated when looked at from the inside. This spring Mr. Comstock and I attended a course of lectures on public institutions by Franklin B. Sanborn, the biographer of Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau. Sanborn's lectures were interesting, although wandering and sketchy. For us the value of the course lay in our Saturday trips to visit institutions we could reach-Willard State Mental Hospital, Auburn Prison, Elmira Reformatory, and our county courthouse and jails. After these visits Mr. Sanborn would give us the latest ideas as to how each should be conducted; and I believe that we all regarded the course as valuable training for citizenship. Pro­ fessor Sanborn, a charming man socially, was frequently a guest in our home. He was a transcendentalist. As an example of his methods of thought, this incident is pertinent : there had been a scandal in the University, through the theft of examination papers from the printing office. To avoid any such danger, Pro- 149 THE COMSTOCKS OF CORNELL fessor Sanborn had his examination papers printed in Boston. His class was large, and, for the examination, was divided into forenoon and afternoon sections. To the astonishment of the morning section, the examination papers contained the ques­ tions for both sections . Needless to say the afternoon section was well prepared. In June, 1 885, I received my degree, taking my diploma from the hand of President White; this was the last class that was so honored. Mr. Comstock had asked that his salary be raised, stat­ ing that my doctor's bill, of several hundred dollars, was not yet wholly paid. His request was not granted but it brought us a beautiful experience. Professor Henry S. Williams, head of Cor­ nell 's Geology Department, came to Harry, handed him some bonds, and told him he could have the use of them as long as he needed. All of our lives, we have been grateful to this noble, kindly man. Later, through his influence, his brother, George R. Williams, a Cornell trustee, looked over the Entomology De­ partment and talked with Mr. Comstock about his plans for its development, a visit that resulted in an advance in Harry's salary. In the summer of 1 885 Mr. Comstock conducted his first sum­ mer term in entomology. He had sixteen students, several of them graduates, and he found his class most satisfactory. It was the beginning of the policy that made his work so successful. It offered an opportunity for a graduate student to do a trimester's work in the summer, and many came. His plan was to give two mornings each week to collecting and studying insects in the field and to spend the rest of the time in working up the material collected. As there were no other classes, these students gave all of their time to entomology. The varied environment of Ithaca affords a wide range of forms and summer is the best season for the study of insect life. I had sent some of my scientific drawings to the New Orleans Exposition of 1 885 and received first honorable mention. I still have a diploma and the blue ribbon of award, signed by Julia Ward Howe and Isabel Greeley. This recognition encouraged me so that I took up my engraving with new vigor. 1 50 1 88 1-1888 Charles Kendall Adams was inaugurated in November, 1 885, as President of Cornell University, and occupied the residence next to ours on the Campus. As a result, our end of the Campus was landscaped and became a more important section. President Adams' household consisted of his wife, a fine, dignified woman who sacrificed much of her time and strength in caring for her invalid niece, an interesting young woman and a great sufferer. Also with them was President Adams' mother, the highest type of New England womanhood. "Grandma Adams," we called her, and we loved her devotedly. She was seventy-eight years old, keen, intelligent, and simple in her way of living. In the fall of 1 885, Harry had trouble with his eyes and had to wear glasses. There were several cases of typhoid fever this autumn and the burden of seeing that they were properly cared for fell on him because he was president of the students' guild, an organization to which students contributed small sums each year to cover expenses, in case of sickness. There was no hospital in Ithaca until many years afterward. Harry and I were disappointed at having no children of our own and at this time thought seriously of adopting a child. Had an attractive child for adoption appeared within our range of vision, we should certainly have taken it. My husband and I worked hard at the University and our only hours of rest came when we took long drives with our pony over the picturesque hill roads about Ithaca. These drives were usu­ ally taken on Saturdays. On Sundays we attended chapel twice ; our reward that autumn lay in hearing Lyman Abbott, Edward Everett Hale, H. R. Haweis, and Washington Gladden. In 1 886 I did social work for the Cornell Christian Association, despite my too liberal views. One of our friends explained it by saying, "Mrs. Comstock may not be much of a Christian but she is great as an association." Mr. Comstock had asked definitely to have his salary raised. He had a long talk about his ideals for his department with Presi­ dent Adams, who seemed interested but said that he considered entomology a part of zoology and thought it could be cared for by an instructor: This instance illustrates President Adams' lack 1 5 1 THE COMSTOCKS OF CORNELL of vision and of real interest in the scientific work of Cornell University. He was so different from President White in relation to science at Cornell that all scientists in the faculty felt discour­ aged, and our famous Professor William A. Anthony, head of the Physics Department, resigned. President Adams was a good and an able man, but he had little imagination. However, he learned by experience, and his troublous seven years as President of Cornell produced a crop of wisdom in him which the University of Wisconsin harvested later. Mrs. Simon Gage had also become interested in wood engrav­ ing. Always practical, she had sought instruction in the art and was receiving correspondence lessons from John P. Davis, teacher of wood engraving at Cooper Union, in New York City. I read his letters and concluded that I too would like to study with him. Accordingly I made arrangements to go to New York soon after Thanksgiving. There, Professor Russel, Cornell's former Vice­ President, met me at the train and took me to a boardinghouse in Washington Square where he and his daughters lived. This was convenient for my work at Cooper Union and gave me de­ lightful society at table. The experience at Cooper Union was a wonderful one, for Mr. Davis was a lovable man, a gifted teacher, and a true artist . The room assigned to our engraving class was long, high, and rather dingy. It was well lighted by windows on one side, and by an arrangement of sash shades the light came in above our heads and fell upon our work. The opposite wall was hung with well selected specimens of wood engravings. We sat at one long table, under the windows and facing them; each of us worked on a block of boxwood, placed upon a leather cushion filled with sand to insure solidity; each had her tools, and the study from which she was engraving was placed against the wall in front of her; most of us worked with an engraver's lens, held high above the block by a standard, but some students used spectacles that magnified. In 1 885 there were a dozen of us in the engraving class, and we came from the four corners of the United States. Our red letter days were the three mornings of the week when Mr. Davis gave us instruction in engraving. After many years, it 1 52 188 1-1888 is difficult to tell why his students liked him so much, but I recall that when we heard his step outside the door and saw him as he came in with a breezy good morning and genial laugh, we were elated. He criticized our work so kindly and tactfully that we felt honored rather than disgraced. His criticism was constructive, the kind that results in improvement rather than in discourage­ ment. He sat beside each of us in turn, took the tool from the unskilled hand, and cut wondrous lines upon the block. His con­ versation was sincere and earnest, yet graced with flashes of humor. It was almost as much of an education to us as were his lessons upon the blocks. He was wont to tell us that we "must see and feel and live," before we could expect much of ourselves as artists. One of the pupils asked him, in despair, after he had given her a lesson upon her block, "Oh, Mr. Davis ! How shall I ever learn to cut a line so full of feeling as this?" He looked at her with a puzzled expression and t�en his face lighted up as•he said, "Read Browning, my dear child, read Browning." We knew that Mr. Davis had a studio in a mysterious "some­ where" and that it was the meeting place of the Society of Ameri­ can Wood Engravers, a coterie of masters whom we mentioned with bated breath. We looked with awe upon some favored mem­ bers of our class for they had . met a few of these demigods­ Kingsley, King, and French. Two years later, Mr. Davis allowed me to work for a time in this studio, this Elysian Field where our Olympians met. The memory of these happy days remained throughout my life, as an inspiration. My bungling hand forgot to blunder when the master stopped his own work to read to us pages from "Saul" and "Paracelsus," to teach us art from "Andrea del Sarto" and "Fra Lippo Lippi," or to sing to us passages from The Creation or The Messiah . With music in our ears, the spirit of Browning in our souls, and the grace of God, as exemplified in our teacher, in our hearts, small excuse had we if we did not become masters. That winter I spent about six weeks under Mr. Davis' instruction and then came home to practice what I had learned. I had always taken insects as the subjects of my lessons, so that if the results were good, the engravings could be used in my husband's text- 1 53 THE COMSTOCKS OF CORNELL book. In addition to my work on the engravings for the book, I did. some line engraving for one of the Cornell professors in en­ gmeermg. In the spring of 1 886, Mr. Comstock had more than thirty students in his entomology courses. He was so busy teaching all day that he tried to write his textbook in the evenings. He began to use the typewriter, thinking that it would not tire him so much as writing by hand; but this experiment did not last many months. In the spring, he began a new phase of entomological instruction, apiculture. He obtained three colonies of bees which he divided into five, and we were all interested in seeing them established in the area east of our property. The honorary society of Sigma Xi was formed at Cornell in 1 886. There had been a feeling for some time that a society for the recognition of students in science should be established, com­ parable to Phi Beta Kappa for students in arts. The engineers were especially keen for such an organization. One of the in­ structors, Frank Van Vleck, was the prime mover in the enter­ prise. Mr. Comstock represented zoology, as Dr. Wilder was opposed to any kind of Greek-letter society. Professor Henry S . Williams, who represented geology, was influential in forming the organization's policies . At first it was thought that Sigma Xi might be limited to Cornell University. But scientists at other institutions became interested and chapters were organized in the leading universities in the United States . In December, 1 888, Mrs. Simon Gage and I were elected among the first women ac­ corded this honor. After Mr. Comstock finished his term's work he went with a friertd to the Adirondacks for fishing, for he needed a rest before his summer teaching. He became expert in trout fishing and it gave him pleasure and recreation. Our friend Charles Thurber graduated in June, 1 887, and I entertained his parents and his aunt and uncle during Com­ mencement week. Mr. Thurber was soon appointed private secretary to President Adams, and had a room with us during this summer. He was learning to ride a high wheel, the only kind of bicycle known then, and hardly a day passed for the first few 1 54 1881-1888 weeks that he did not come home for bandages, but he was no quitter and rode on to final success. The next year he was ap­ pointed registrar and did heroic work in starting the present card system, in place of dear old Dr. William Dexter Wilson's rather sketchy records. The summer term for entomology kept Harry very busy, but the wisdom of his judgment, regarding the advantages of the summer season for the study of insect life, became more appar­ ent. The following was the first formal announcement concern­ ing Cornell 's summer course in entomology. CORNELL UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY AND GENERAL INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY. Summer Course of 1 886 The summer course in Entomology and General Invertebrate Zo­ ology of Cornell University will begin Monday, June 2 1 st, and con­ tinue ten weeks. The course will be given at the University and will comprise lectures, laboratory practice and field work. The laboratory and field work will be arranged with reference to the needs and attainments of each student. After completing an ele­ mentary course in either general zoology or entomology the student may select some subject in systematic zoology, economic entomology, or insect anatomy for special investigation. It is planned to have the work of each student, as far as possible, an original investigation. The chief object of the course is to give training in methods of natural history work. Members of this class will have free use of the library and all other privileges of students of the University. Tuition will be free to college graduates, and to undergraduates taking regular courses in this Uni­ versity; for all other persons the fee for the term will be $25. Those desiring to join the class should make application before June 1 0th. Address: Professor J. H. Comstock, Ithaca, N.Y. Harry attended the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science at Buffalo in August, 1 887, and we went to Otto for our vacation. Mr. G. K. Gilbert, who had at­ tended the meeting, went with us. He enjoyed our beautiful 1 55 THE COMSTOCKS OF CORNELL Cattaraugus County hills, and Mother and Father enjoyed his company. During this vacation Harry and Father had glorious days hunting bee trees, a diversion that took them over hill and dale, beautiful in early autumn coloring. In the fall of 1 887, Cornell had 300 freshmen, a large class for any university at that time. This made about 750 students at Cornell. Mr. Comstock had only thirty-five attending his lec­ tures, but his laboratory was crowded. In October, we rejoiced with Professor and Mrs. Gage in the birth of their son, Henry Phelps Gage. Former President and Mrs. White returned from Europe this autumn and we were all happy to see them. George Burr 5 had been searching libraries in Europe for Mr. White and had discovered a valuable manuscript that had been lost for three hundred years. All were proud of his success. In November I went to Cooper Union for further in­ struction from Mr. Davis, with special reference to the engrav­ ing of insects. After his talk with President Adams, Mr. Comstock had been so discouraged about the future of his department that he con­ cluded he had made a mistake in his profession and sent for catalogues of medical colleges. I felt that with my two resources, as natural history artist and engraver, I could probably keep us going while Harry was studying. After reaching this conclusion, we were surprised and delighted to learn that the Cornell trustees had raised Mr. Comstock's salary to $2 ,500. From New York, where I was studying, we went to Otto for Christmas, and with the new year, 1 888, returned to Ithaca, full of enthusiasm for our work on the entomology textbook. About this time Mr. Comstock began the experiment of photo­ graphing my drawings and printing them on boxwood blocks­ a device just coming into vogue and proving to be very helpful, since the engraver had only to follow the lines of the photo­ graphic print. My husband soon became expert at this. He made 5 George Lincoln Burr had been a student of history under President White and was one of the Comstocks' best friends. Burr stayed at Cornell and became Goldwin Smith Professor of History.-R.G.S. 156 188 1-1888 a black box three feet long, just large enough to admit the print­ ing frame at one end; by pointing the other end toward the sun he was able to get the direct rays and thus make a sharp print. He was firm in refusing invitations for evenings, but he made an exception when my sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, gave a faculty reception at Sage College, the first time a sorority had dared so much. The girls made the cake at my house and Mrs. Estevan Fuertes, wife of a Cornell professor and mother of Louis Agassiz Fuertes, allowed Beth Boynton, later Mrs. Frederick Coville, the use of her kitchen, where that capable young woman cooked a washboiler full of fowls and made a delectable chicken salad. In February, 1 886, a Farmers' Institute was held at Cornell . Mr. Comstock and I wrote letters and addressed circulars and invitations, to help Professor Isaac P. Roberts, Director of the College of Agriculture. The Institute was a great success . The chief speaker was my cousin, former Congressman Edwin Wil­ lits. His address was so admirable that Professor Roberts had it printed at his own expense for his students. In 1 885 Cousin Edwin had been made President of Michigan State College at Lansing, an office which he filled successfully for four years, resigning to become Assistant Secretary of Agriculture. Mr. Comstock made addresses at other Farmers' Institutes that winter, one of them at Oswego, which enabled him to visit Captain Turner again. Harry was asked to edit the entomological section of the A merican Naturalist in 1 887, and he continued to do so for three years. In the spring term of 1 887 twenty attended the lectures in entomology. The laboratory was full and seven were taking apiculture. One of the experiences of this class was the cutting of a bee tree and the transfer of the bees to a hive. Professor Goldwin Smith was visiting former President White and both of them came over, put on veils, and inspected the tree and the hives. Mr. White came over afterwards and, again pro­ tected by a veil, examined the bees. with Mr. Comstock. The social event of that spring was the reception given by Mrs. Ezra Cornell with the aid of her daughters, Mrs. J . B. Blair and 1 57 THE COMSTOCKS OF CORNELL Miss Mary Cornell, to celebrate Mrs. Cornell's seventy-sixth birthday. Mrs. Cornell was a woman of great dignity and we all prized this opportunity of meeting her. Just before Commencement in 1 887, our Cornell community was grieved by the sudden death of Mrs. Andrew D. White. We had been present at a party at the Whites' only a few days before, and Mrs. White had seemed well. We were afraid that her loss would have an injurious effect upon Mr. White's health, which was never robust. Mrs. White was gentle, thoughtful, and con­ siderate of others. These characteristics, added to her delicate beauty · and gracious manner, had endeared her to everyone. I spent the day after her death at the house of mourning, giving what help I might. To add to the sorrow of this Commencement, one of our fairest young women students fell into Cascadilla gorge and was killed. In June, 1 887, Harry took another vacation for trout fishing in the Adirondacks. Charles Wing, later Professor of Civil En­ gineering at Stanford University, was one of the party, and this fishing trip established an enduring friendship between Wing and Comstock. Harry came home brown and vigorous and with a basketful of trout which we shared with former President White, President Adams' family, and other neighbors. In August Grove Karl Gilbert and John P. Davis of Cooper Union came for a visit, the former for two or three days and the latter for two weeks. After luncheon on the day of their arrival, while we were on the piazza, some laborers were digging a ditch on the University Campus, below our house. Our bees did not like this intrusion and attacked the men, who protected themselves by throwing soil at them. Mr. Davis took Mr. Gilbert to view the fray and cried, "Geology versus Entomology ! Which do you bet on?" Mr. Davis gave me lessons in wood engraving during the morn­ ings, and in the afternoons we went sketching. One afternoon we were sketching on the shores of Beebe Lake when suddenly he dropped his brushes, stood up under a great hemlock, and sang "The Brook," from Haydn's Creation. George Burr was with us much this summer; he used to come 1 58 1881-1888 to supper early enough to play tennis on our lawn court. Other frequent visitors were Mary Roberts, Professor Roberts' daugh­ ter, and Gertrude Van Dusen, a cataloguer in the Cornell Li­ brary, who stayed with me while Harry went to New York in August to attend the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He had worked hard at preparing a paper for this meeting, in the intervals of his teaching, but he felt repaid by the interest and appreciation that were accorded it. C. V. Riley was at the meeting, in a conciliatory mood; Mr. Comstock met him halfway and the hatchet was buried. As soon as the term closed, late in August, Mr. Comstock, John Sted­ man, a Cornel l student, and I went to Maine to collect material for the course in invertebrates, which always preceded the course in entomology. We settled at Linekin on Booth Bay, and used a fishhouse on the beach for a laboratory. A can of alcohol, for preserving specimens, fascinated the village idlers, who said they could smell it a mile away. Mr. Comstock was afraid that the temptation might be too strong, in this prohibition state, and hastened to put some repulsive animals to pickle in it. We had the use of sailboats and rowboats for our collecting. The sea fauna along that coast is rich in quantity and variety of form­ the most interesting of any that we had ever found. On our way back to Ithaca we visited Wellesley College and had the pleasure of dining with Alice Freeman Palmer, its President. In the autumn of 1 887, Mark Slingerland, later a Cornell pro­ fessor, entered Cornell . Mark had been my pupil when I taught school in Otto. I had found him exceedingly bright, had encour­ aged him to come to college, and had promised to find him work to pay part of his expenses. He had passed the Cornell entrance examination with a high grade. Clara Kerr, the daughter of a cousin of my mother, entered with the same class, and was a joy to us during her college course. In October, our friend Gertrude Van Dusen, on leave from the Cornell Library, sailed for Europe for a two years' stay. We missed her witty conversation and her skillful piano playing. Other events of this autumn were a visit from Dr. David Starr Jordan, then President of Indiana Uni­ versity and an alumni trustee of Cornell, and the coming of 1 59 THE COMSTOCKS OF CORNELL Professor and Mrs. Benjamin Ide Wheeler to live in the second house from ours. 6 Mr. Comstock had taken great interest in organizing an Ex­ periment Station at Cornell. Austin Wadsworth, President of the New York State Agricultural Society and ex officio a trustee of Cornell, came to Ithaca because he was interested in the project. President Adams invited Mr. Comstock to dine with him. Soon after this, Harry spoke at a Farmers' Institute at Al­ bion, New York, and I went with him. There I also met Mr. Wadsworth. I had read about the Genesee Valley fox hunts and knew that Mr. Wadsworth owned foxhounds; this had preju­ diced me against him, and I was unprepared to find him such a fine man. I felt acquainted with him at once, and when he came to Ithaca to perfect the organization of the Experiment Station, we invited him to stay for several days with us-an invitation we should hardly have given, had we known of the luxury in which he lived at home. He was a gracious guest and entered into our simple life as naturally as if born to it. He was also interested in my engravings. In March, 1 888, my husband and I spoke before a Farmers' Institute at Hornellsville. The happy side of farm life had al­ ways appealed to me, and the conductor of the Institute asked me to give a cheerful message to the assembled women. The manuscript for half of the textbook, A n Introduction to Entomology, was sent to the printer in March, 1 888. Mr. Com­ stock was determined that my engravings for this book should have the best possible printing. Therefore he chose the DeVinne Press of New York, famous for its engravings in magazines, al­ though the cost was greater than with other printers . Mr. Com­ stock had forty students in entomology, this spring term, and the laboratory was crowded, but he hoped to have the textbook before the end of the term. Vain hope l The Hatch bill, establishing experiment stations at the Land­ grant Colleges of the United States, passed Congress and was signed by the President in 1 887. Professor Roberts was made s Later, Dr. Jordan became President of Stanford University and Dr. Wheeler, President of the University of California.-R.G.S. 160 1881-1888 Director of the Cornell Experiment Station and this pleased us. Delay in getting the bill through meant that the funds were not available until the last of April. Since this was too late for start­ ing experiments, the money was used for equipment. Then Mr. Comstock realized one of his many dreams for his department. He asked for an "Insectary"-a greenhouse where he could grow the plants on which insect� feed and could study the life histories and habits of the injurious species. Because he had his plan ready, he obtained a goodly share of the funds, and by May first, a site for the building was staked off, just behind our home. The con­ tract, providing for a two-story cottage with a glass house sixty feet long attached to it, wa,11 let for $2,500. Two rooms on the first floor, one on each side of the entrance hall, were to be used as offices; one room upstairs was for storage and the other was for a student janitor. There were two divisions to the conservatory­ one to be used as a hothouse and the other to be kept cold. There was a dark room for photography and running water for aquaria; outside there were several pits bricked up, for holding root cages with glass sides in which plants could be grown and which could be lifted out for observation of the habits of insects infesting the roots. This Insectary (see Figure 2) was the first building of its. kind in the world. A� Mr. Comstock had coined the name "insectary," he was. asked to define the word for the Century Dictionary. From the Hatch fund he also obtained $400 for a microscope and money for two student assistants. I wrote my mother: "Harry is the happiest entomologist in all America." As the appropria­ tion had to be spent before the first of July, work on the Insectary was hastened and he watched every phase of its erection eagerly. In June he tore himself away for a fishing trip in the Adiron­ dacks. We moved equipment into the Insectary in the first week of July, when it was practically completed. It was of great interest to the Cornell Campus neighborhood. Andrew D. White was enthusiastic about it, but some had their doubts. Professor Moses Coit Tyler, after looking through the building, ,11aid he hoped we would keep the windows closed and all the bugs inside. Mr. 1 6 1 THE COMSTOCKS OF CORNELL Comstock assured him that any of the insects that we reared would rather starve than take a bite out of a professor, for of all creatures the insects were the most "notional" about their food. I found a north window in the Insectary office which gave me a good light for my engravings, a charming outlook into the woods, and a glimpse of Cayuga Lake. For twenty years, my father had been renting the farm on which I was born, and it had deteriorated steadily. He and my mother decided to return to it for one year and try to "bring it back." Father was seventy years old, yet well and strong. Mother was sixty-five and far from well, but she was so interested in this experiment in conservation that she improved in health during the summer. It was a valuable experiment, for it helped improve the farm and it taught my ambitious parents that they were not so strong as they thought they were, when it carne to farm work. Harry and I enjoyed our vacation that summer. We slept at a little homestead which it had been the delight of my childhood to visit. We spent our days on my horne farm and I renewed my acquaintance with the trees of the virgin forest, still standing near the house, and with the birds-the hermit, wood, and Wil­ son thrushes, the teacher bird, and many others. The view from the farm was magnificent : rolling hills with their farmsteads, and along the western horizon blue Lake Erie, thirty miles away. Cornell had an entering class of four hundred in the fall of 1 888, and we were all encouraged. George Burr carne to live with us; he had not been well and needed the regularity of horne life. We could not give him a room in the house, but he chose to room with the student in the new Insectary. In the autumn we went to Geneseo to attend a Farmers' Insti­ tute and were Austin Wadsworth's guests at "Homestead," a great house, filled with treasures collected by three generations of Wadsworths who had traveled far and wide. For the next thirty years we visited "Homestead" at least once a year. The first part of the textbook, A n Introduction to Entomol­ ogy/ was published November 1 , 1 888 . When the book appeared 7 An Introduction to Entomology, by John Henry Comstock, with many original illustrations drawn and engraved by Anna Botsford Comstock, r 888. This book of 16:1 1888-1891 we both felt the depression common to authors and artists at such times. We were almost discouraged, for the book did not seem to amount to much, after all of our labor. But when letters began to come from entomologists expressing their appreciation of it, we felt more cheerful. Fifteen copies were sold in the first week and that seemed to augur well for the future. Chapter 9 )£( 1 888- 1 89 1 Studies of Entomology in Europe and America FOR a long time Mr. Comstock had struggled with the German language, in which so many treatises on zoology were written. He had concluded that a winter in Germany was necessary be­ fore he could finish Part II of his textbook, An Introduction to Entomology. We sailed on the steamship "Westernland" Decem­ ber 15 , 1 888. We had a pleasant but rather cold voyage. The captain would not allow the ship to be heated, for he had a cargo of cotton and was afraid of fire. There were only seven first class passengers . We landed at Antwerp December 28 and were interested in the two-wheeled carts loaded with milk and produce and the hard­ working dogs that drew them. From Antwerp we went to Aix-la­ Chapelle and visited Charlemagne's cathedral, thence to Co­ logne and paid awed tribute to the beauty of the cathedral . There we took a "gepack" boat up the Rhine River, from St. Goar to 234 pages, bound in paper, treated of only eight of the twenty-five orders of in­ sects that Professor Comstock described in his much later and more elaborate An Introduction to Entomology ( 1925). There was no second edition of the paper­ covered book. Instead of completing it with a discussion of the remaining orders of insects, the Comstocks planned and in 1895 published an entirely new book, A Manual for the Study of lnsects.-G.W.H.
