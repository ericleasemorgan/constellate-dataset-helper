It was in the late 18th century when the American essayist,
poet, and philosopher Henry David Thoreau quoted “It’s not
what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.” Indeed, more
than 200 years later, this phrase is still valid and relevant,
especially in the field of gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy.
Endoscopists in the whole world are working hard to
improve diagnosis and therapy of our patients. Despite these
efforts, we are still confronted with some limitations of GI
endoscopy including the lack of detection of colon polyps
(i.e., significant adenoma miss rates), delayed diagnosis, and
difficult areas to access, like the pancreatobiliary tract or the
small bowel.
In the attempt to overcome these limitations, new endoscopic
techniques are constantly being introduced. New
endoscopic imaging techniques now allow for amore detailed
analysis of mucosal and submucosal structures and include
virtual chromoendoscopy, magnification endoscopy, and
endocytoscopy. Various studies have shown the usefulness
of these imaging techniques for conditions such as Barrett’s
esophagus, colon polyps, and early neoplasias of the luminal
GI tract. Moreover, the recently introduced confocal laser
endomicroscopy (CLE) system allows us to analyze structures
at the cellular and subcellular layer thereby obtaining an
optical biopsy during ongoing endoscopy. Besides, CLE has
the potential to visualize fluorescence labeled structures
against specific epitopes, that is, in gastrointestinal cancer or
inflammatory bowel disease, thus adding molecular imaging
to the field of endoscopic research. Furthermore, with
the development of balloon-assisted endoscopy and capsule
endoscopy, the endoscopist is now able to visualize the
entire small bowel. Lastly, visualization beyond the mucosa
is also important. This is accomplished with endoscopic
ultrasonography (EUS). EUS plays now a pivotal role for
the management and therapy of various diseases. Through
EUS, the “eye” of the endoscopist is extended beyond the
lumen allowing for a detailed examination of most adjacent
structures to the luminal GI tract.
This special issue focuses on the exiting new developments
of GI endoscopy.We are proud to present original arti-
cles and state-of-the-art reviews on the latest developments
in the field of advanced endoscopic imaging. We are aware
that it is impossible to cover the entire spectrum of advanced
endoscopy in only one issue. The presented topics, however,
highlight someof themost current aspects, controversies, and
recommendations in selected areas of advanced GI imaging.
B. E. Bluen and coworkers analyzed the impact of EUSFNA
on patient management. Files from 268 patients were
evaluated. In the conclusion, the authors suggest that the
diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA might be improved further
by taking more FNA passes from suspected lesions,
optimizing needle selection, having an experienced echoendoscopist
available during the learning curve, and lastly
having a cytologist present during the procedure. C. Xu
et al. reviewed the technique and applications of contrastenhanced
harmonic EUS (CH-EUS) in pancreatic diseases
and compared the technique to computed tomography, magnetic
resonance imaging, and conventional EUS.The authors
concluded that CH-EUS could be used for adequate sampling
 2 Diagnostic andTherapeutic Endoscopy
of pancreatic tumors but could not replace EUS-FNA now.
Mohammad-Alizadeh and coworkers evaluated the efficacy
of limited sphincterotomy plus large balloon dilation for
removal of biliary stones in a prospective nonrandomized
study including 50 patients. The authors described that the
combined approach is an effective and safe treatment in
patients with challenging bile duct stones.
M. Iwatate et al. evaluated NBI (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan)
and NBI combined with magnification for the evaluation of
colorectal lesions and additionally gave an outlook on future
prospects. Digital chromoendoscopy techniques were evaluated
in two different trials of this special issue. C. E. O. dos
Santos and coworkers presented the results of a prospective
randomized study comparing the accuracy of Fujinon Intelligent
Color Enhancement (FICE; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and
real-time chromoendoscopy for the differential diagnosis of
diminutive (<5mm) neoplastic and nonneoplastic colorectal
lesions and found that both approaches showed high
accuracy for the histopathological diagnosis of diminutive
colorectal lesions. S. Hancock et al. described the potential of
i-scan (Pentax, Tokyo, Japan) in clinical endoscopic practice
in upper and lower endoscopic procedures and described
the potential usefulness of this technique for real-time diagnosis
and characterization of GI lesions. The small bowel
was discussed in two manuscripts of this special issue. H.
Suzuki et al. described the successful treatment of early stage
jejunal adenocarcinoma by endoscopic mucosal resection
using double-balloon enteroscopy. Whereas there are several
reports on polypectomy of the small bowel, this is the first
report of EMR of this part of the GI tract. J. Chen and J. Lee
reviewed the current development of machine-vision-based
analysis of wireless capsule endoscopy, thereby focusing on
the research that identifies specific gastrointestinal pathology
andmethods of shot boundary detection. CLE is an advanced
endoscopic imaging technique. R. Pittayanon et al. described
for the first time the learning curve of CLE for assessment
of gastric intestinal metaplasia. The authors found that after
a short session of training, even beginners could achieve a
high level of accuracy with a substantial level of interobserver
agreement. Foersch et al. described the potential ofmolecular
imaging using CLE for imaging of COX-2 activity in murine
sporadic and colitis-associated colorectal cancer.The authors
pose a proof of concept and suggested the use of CLE for
the detection of COX-2 expression during colorectal cancer
surveillance. Finally, S. Peter et al. presented a state-of-the-art
review on the potential of CLE for real-time histopathological
evaluation of the pancreaticobiliary system. They concluded
that the novel use of this technique is particularly of significance
in differentiating indeterminate biliary strictures as
treatment depends on an accurate and prompt diagnosis.
We highly appreciate the excellent contributions of all
authors of this special issue and want to encourage all
readers to be receptive on the rapidly growing field of
advanced endoscopic imaging. Nonetheless, just utilizing a
new method is not enough; a clear understanding of how the
method is used and how the findings are interpreted is the
key for a successful endoscopy: “It’s not what you look at that
matters, it’s what you see.”
