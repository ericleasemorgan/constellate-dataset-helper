Abstract. Our faith in the seeds of equatorial plasma irregularities
holds that there will generally always be density per-
turbations sufficient to provide the seeds for irregularity development
whenever the Rayleigh–Taylor instability is ac-
tive. When the duration of the time of the Rayleigh–Taylor
instability is short, however, the magnitude of the seed perturbations
can make a difference in whether the irregularities
have a chance to grow to a strength at which the nonlinear
development of plumes occurs. In addition, the character of
the resulting irregularities reflects the characteristics of the
initial seed density perturbation, e.g., their strength, spacing,
and, to some extent, their spatial scales, and it is important
to know the seeds to help determine the structure of the developed
irregularities. To this end, we describe the climatol-
ogy of daytime and early-evening density irregularities that
can serve as seeds for later development of plumes, as determined
from the Planar Langmuir Probe (PLP) plasma density
measurements on the C/NOFS (Communication and Navigation
Outage Forecast System) satellite mission, presenting
their magnitude as a function of altitude, latitude, longitude,
local time, season, and phase in the solar cycle (within the
C/NOFS observation era). To examine some of the consequences
of these density perturbations, they are used as initial
conditions for the PBMOD (Retterer, 2010a) 3-D irregularity
model to follow their potential development into larger-
amplitude irregularities, plumes, and radio scintillation.

1 Introduction
There is much that remains poorly understood about the origins
of plasma density irregularities in the low-latitude region
of Earth’s ionosphere (Kelley et al., 2011). These irregularities,
first observed in ionosonde traces, have subsequently
been observed by incoherent-scatter radars and in airglow
images of the night sky, in situ measurements of plasma
density and velocity, and by numerous other means. They
are believed to begin as small-amplitude density variations
which are then amplified by the exponential growth in time
that is characteristic of plasma instabilities like the Rayleigh–
Taylor (RT) instability of the bottomside of the ionospheric
F layer (Kelley, 1989) until their amplitudes are large enough
that nonlinear interactions significantly modify their structure,
leading to rising plumes of low-density plasma filled
with turbulence.
Bubble formation can occur anytime that the Rayleigh–
Taylor growth rate is large enough for a long enough time
for significant irregularities to develop. Generally they form
at night, when the E region conductivity is small (otherwise,
the E region conductivity will short out the growing polarization
electric fields and prevent the feedback that leads to
the instability). Uplift of the F layer aids the instability by
moving the plasma layer into altitudes where the neutral collision
frequencies are weaker and the RT growth rate is con-
sequently larger. Thus, bubbles are often seen shortly after
sunset, when the prereversal enhancement of the upward drift
leads to stronger growth rates, but they can be seen at other
times of night when other mechanisms produce electric fields
that cause the uplift of the F layer (Yizengaw et al., 2013).
Because the RT instability initially merely amplifies the
structure of the perturbations, a number of the characteristics
of the original irregularities (for example, the zonal spac-
ing of plumes) are carried over into the developed turbulent

Fig. 1. The sensitivity of bubble development to the magnitude of
the initial perturbation as well as the magnitude of the Rayleigh–
Taylor growth rate. Vz peak is the maximum vertical velocity (in
m s−1) over the grid of the 2-D simulation of plume development;
the upward jump in Vz peak indicates the formation of plumes. The
panels of the plot show the results for the different prereversal ambient
drifts, which control the strength of the Rayleigh–Taylor growth
rate. The different color curves represent the results of simulations
with different initial magnitude perturbations: black, blue, and red
represent a maximum perturbation 0.003, 0.01, and 0.03 times the
peak ambient density, respectively.
plumes. Moreover, when the time interval in the post-sunset
sector in which the RT growth rate is significant is short, the
strength of evening irregularities can be as much dependent
on the initial amplitudes of the irregularities as it is on the
strength of the RT instability because the stronger the initial
perturbation is, the less Rayleigh–Taylor growth is re-
quired to boost the irregularities into the nonlinear regime.
Figure 1 illustrates this situation. Several (two-dimensional,
for simplicity) simulations (Retterer, 2010a) of plume formation
are performed, with both different strengths of the
RT instability (set by the magnitude of the prereversal vertical
drift of the ambient plasma – higher drift means stronger
RT growth rate) and initial density perturbations of different
magnitudes, with the peak density perturbation 0.003,
0.01, or 0.03 times the F peak ambient density. The quantity
plotted is the peak vertical plasma drift within the sim-
ulation volume as a function of time. A rapid growth of this
drift indicates that a plume of low-density, rapidly upwardrising
plasma has formed. The top panel shows that when the
RT instability is weak, none of these perturbations is sufficient
to trigger plume formation. With the next largest RT
growth rate, only the biggest initial density perturbation triggers
plume development. With stronger RT growth, smaller
initial perturbations can trigger plume development, but it is
always the biggest initial perturbation (the red curves) that
initiates plume formation soonest and produces the strongest
plumes (as marked by the peak magnitude of the vertical
drift).
But what are the origins of the initial density fluctuations?
What are their expected spatial and temporal scales? What
are their seasonal, latitudinal, and longitudinal occurrence
climatologies, and can knowing this help us forecast the
probability of plume formation and radio scintillation? One
of the processes that lead to ion density variations is momentum
exchange with neutral constituents of the thermosphere,
whereby the friction with the neutral component can induce
the ions to drift in the same way as the neutral wind. When
the neutral wind varies periodically as in a wave, the ion drift
can be found to vary periodically in the same way. As the ion
drift responds to the varying neutral wind, the plasma density
responds in the way dictated by the continuity equation,
producing density perturbations that can be amplified in the
RT instability.
Wave perturbations in the winds and density are pervasive
features of the neutral atmosphere that exist over a wide
range of spatial and temporal scales. Winds are responsible
for many of the major electrodynamic features of the ionosphere
through the production of dynamo current systems
(Fejer, 2011). In addition to the larger-scale tidal oscillations
and planetary waves (Maute et al., 2012), there also exist
smaller-scale gravity waves (Hines, 1974), traveling neutral
disturbances that induce corresponding wave variations in
the ionospheric plasma (Hooke, 1968). There are a number
of sources for these waves, ranging from storm-time energy
inputs at high latitudes to tropospheric storm systems at low
and middle latitudes (Hagan and Forbes, 2003).
Note that as the wave-like plasma density perturbations
are supported and maintained by polarization electric fields
that develop within their structure, the notion that, for the
Rayleigh–Taylor instability, the strength of the growth rate
and the initial density perturbation are independent quantities
is illusory. Large-scale wave structures (Tsunoda, 2010)
can provide both the initial density perturbation and enhancements
in the upward plasma drift that enhance the Rayleigh–
Taylor growth rate. Typically, what is seen in the simulations
(Retterer, 2010a) is that plumes initially develop from the
points where the bottomside of the F layer is the highest in

the C/NOFS satellite on day 281 of 2010, at around 22 UT. The
top panel gives the density perturbation (red curve, in number per
cm3) determined by high-pass filtering of the observations. The second
panel gives the density perturbation normalized by the ambient
density. (The gray lines in these panels mark the time of 18:00 LT,
the yellow lines the time of 06:00 LT.) The third panel gives the altitude
of the satellite at the time of the observation (black curve) and
the apex altitude of the observation point mapped back to the geomagnetic
equator (red curve). The fourth panel gives the latitude of
the observation, while the bottom panel gives the longitude (black

of the observations.
altitude. As a wave propagates along the F layer, it provides
both density perturbations and enhanced plasma drifts.
Empirical knowledge of the phenomenon is the first key
to understanding it. Here we take advantage of the survey
of low-latitude plasma densities provided by the Communication
and Navigation Outage Forecast System (C/NOFS)
satellite from the solar minimum of 2008 through the rising
phase of the solar cycle into 2012. We employ a high-pass
filtering technique to isolate the shorter-term density irregularities
in which we are interested from the smoother varia-
tions of the ambient plasma as the satellite moves around its
low-inclination orbit, sampling the plasma density through
longitudes and local times. We accumulate statistics of the
amplitude of the density fluctuations and plot it as a function
of altitude, latitude, local time, longitude, season, and phase

density perturbations as an initial condition for a 3-D plume
model to demonstrate how the fluctuations will evolve and
how irregularity-filled plumes and radio scintillation can develop
from them.
2 Data analysis
The C/NOFS satellite was launched in April 2008 as a component
of a system to specify and forecast the occurrence of
radio scintillations that interfere with the systems that rely on
transionospheric radio propagation (de La Beaujardiere et al.,
2004). Its orbit was elliptical (400 × 850 km) with low inclination
(13◦) so as to sample the ionospheric plasma in the re-
gion near the geomagnetic equator, one of the regions where

the density irregularities responsible for the scintillation are
found. Among the instruments onboard the satellite, we employ
here the plasma density measurements, Ne(t), from the
planar Langmuir probe (PLP) (Roddy et al., 2010), at a one
sample per second resolution.
To isolate the faster density variations of interest, 1Ne,
from the longer spatial scale or slower variations of the ambient
density (considered to be at along-track scales of 300 km
or more), a smoothed version of the PLP density data series
is formed, Ne0, which is then subtracted from the original
data series, Ne, to leave the variations at the shorter scales,
1Ne = Ne −Ne0. The smoothed density can be estimated either
by a running mean or, if the irregularities expected are
overwhelmingly depletions (reductions in density), estimated
by the envelope of density maxima spaced on an ambientscale
grid throughout the time series. Dao et al. (2011) em-
ployed similar techniques, but looked solely at 1Ne/Ne0,
which is always small in the daytime, to focus on the nighttime
irregularities. A sample of this density-irregularity cal-
culation using data from day 281, year 2010, around 18 UT,
is shown in Fig. 2. The top panel gives 1Ne, the density
irregularity in number per cm3 as calculated by subtracting
the smoothed density from the original signal, and the second
panel gives this density irregularity normalized by the
ambient density, 1Ne/Ne0. The ambient density in this example
was determined using a set of density points sampled
every 40 s, providing a spatial resolution of about 300 km;
thus, 1Ne includes all spatial scales smaller than that (down
to the 8 km resolution due to the sampling rate). The other
panels give information about the time and location of the
observations. The altitude of the satellite is shown in black in
panel three, along with the apex altitude, shown in red (the
altitude at the geomagnetic equator to which the location of
the satellite maps; where the two curves touch, the satellite
is at the geomagnetic equator). The fourth panel shows the
latitude of the satellite, and the fifth panel gives the longitude
(black curve, with axis on the left) and local time (blue
curve, with axis on the right) of the satellite. The gray lines
mark the points where the local time is 18:00 LT, while the
yellow lines mark the points where the local time is 06:00 LT.
We first see in this segment of data, at 21.8 UT (around
10:00 LT), a burst of irregularities with an amplitude of a
few 1000 cm−3, followed by a few more bursts of smaller
amplitude through the afternoon. Because the ambient density
is high during the day, these irregularities have small
fractional strength, 1Ne/Ne0, and may not have much
radio-propagation effect themselves, but they persist beyond
18:00 LT into the early evening, where they can act as seeds
for the development of stronger irregularities amplified by
the RT instability, such as can be seen later in the orbit,
around 22.5 UT (around 20:00 LT).
Another case, from day 282, 2010, is shown in Fig. 3, in
exactly the same format as Fig. 2. Here the sampled dayside
irregularities are smaller, perhaps because the satellite
is farther away from the geomagnetic equator (note the distance
between the satellite altitude and apex altitude in the
third panel), but the early evening irregularities might be
a little larger and have a slower temporal variation (corresponding
to larger spatial scales) than the case in Fig. 2.
The spectral density of the power in these irregularities near
18:00 LT as a function of wave number (mapping from sampled
time to space assuming static structures sampled by the
satellite moving at 8 km s−1) is shown in Fig. 4. We see that
the spectrum is close to a power law, as comparison with
the straight line in this log-log plot suggests, with a spectral
index close to −2. Unfortunately, this seemingly ubiq-
uitous spectral shape in atmospheric fluid turbulence leaves
few clues (like a preferred wavelength) as to the origins of
the waves.
3 Climatology
To produce a more general picture of the occurrence of these
daytime density irregularities, we calculate their climatology,
the statistical description of how their magnitudes vary with
parameters such as altitude, local time, latitude, longitude,
season, and phase of solar cycle, by binning large numbers
of observations of them over a significant period of time. We
choose periods of accumulation that are multiples of the orbital
precession period of the satellite (67 days) to insure bet-
ter uniformity of sampling.

Fig. 5. Climatology of density irregularities as a function of longitude and local time, integrated over altitudes and averaged over seasons
from (Northern Hemisphere) summer 2008 (upper left) to spring equinox 2012 (lower right). The density scale is logarithmic, ranging from
102 to 105 cm−3 for the density irregularities.
Figure 5 shows the climatology of irregularity strength as
a function of longitude and local time through the first four
years of the C/NOFS era. Each panel gives the root-meansquare
magnitude of the irregularities as a function of longi-
tude and local time, integrated over all altitudes (although we
will see later that most of the contribution will come from the
lowest altitudes that the C/NOFS samples). Each row gives
the results for a year, while each column shows the results for
a given season: summer (Northern Hemisphere), fall, winter,
and spring, in order. The sampling for the summer plot was
over 134 days ending on day 249, the sampling for the fall
seasons was over 67 days ending on day 307, that for winter
134 days ending on day 67, and that for spring 67 days ending
on day 123. Through the course of the C/NOFS era, we
see the increases in density due to the stronger plasma photoproduction
in the rising phase of the solar cycle, as well as
seasonal variations, e.g., the daytime irregularities are weakest
in the summer season. Throughout the data set we see
the strong evening and early morning irregularities produced
by the RT amplification, which appear to follow the wellknown
climatology for scintillation and equatorial plasma
bubbles (Gentile et al., 2006): strong through many longitudes
at the spring and fall equinoxes, strong in the Ameri-
can sector in winter, strong in the Pacific sector in summer,
plus the general tendency to increase in intensity as the solar
activity increases. Note how the daytime irregularities persist
into the evening, where they can serve as seeds for the
development of the strong irregularities and plumes under
the influence of the RT instability. There is some suggestion
of the four-node pattern in longitude that is a sign of coupling
with the lower atmosphere (Immel et al., 2006), which
is even more strongly visible in the longitudinal modulations

of the daytime densities in Fig. 6 and the 1Ne/Ne0 perturbations
plotted in Fig. 7 below.
For comparison, Fig. 6 presents the climatology of the ambient
plasma density as a function of longitude and local time
over the same seasons (all the climatology plots will have
this same organization). What is notable here is the steady
increase of densities through the rising phase of the solar cycle,
as well as the hints of the four-node pattern in longitude.
Although the daytime irregularities in Fig. 5 appear to
approximately follow the trends of the ambient density in
Fig. 6, a detailed look at the ratio of density irregularity to
ambient density, 1Ne/Ne0, in the daytime as a function of
local time and longitude in Fig. 7 shows that there is structure
in the ratio, with a hint of the four-node structure in lon-
gitude characteristic of E region tidal control, particularly in
the summer seasons and at solar minimum (2008).
Figure 8 shows the climatology of the rms densityirregularity
magnitudes as a function of altitude and local
time, showing how the irregularities in the midday and afternoon
taper off in magnitude with altitude. The amplified
irregularities due to RT growth in the evening and postmidnight
times are apparent here as well. As the solar cycle
advances toward its peak, the amplified irregularities extend
to larger altitudes as freely convecting plumes develop and
rise to greater heights.
Finally, Fig. 9 gives the climatology of the rms densityirregularity
magnitudes as a function of latitude and local
time. To be able to combine observations from different longitudes,
the latitude parameter that is used is the latitudinal
distance from the geomagnetic equator at the satellite longitude.
We expect that the geomagnetic equator is the center
point of organization of much of the plasma structure, so by

using the distance from that point, we may put equivalent
points at different longitudes on an equal footing to be combined
in one picture. Note, however, that offset between the
geographic and geomagnetic equators and the low inclination
of the C/NOFS orbit means that the north side of the geomagnetic
equator is not sampled to distances as great as the south
side is. There is no consistent seasonal pattern here. There
are lobes in the daytime irregularities that appear on either
side of the equator at different times, with a reversed pattern
the next year. One consistent feature is the lozenge shape of
the amplified irregularities in the evening, due to the rising
of the plumes, and thus the spreading out in latitude of their
motion.
4 Seeding
We next use the low-level density irregularities observed just
before sunset as the initial perturbation in a calculation of
the development of the RT instability in the evening time sector.
To follow the development we use the three-dimensional,
fully nonlinear model of Retterer (2010a). This model assumes
that the ions are inertia-less to solve the momentum
equation (an assumption which is appropriate for F layer
heights). Under this approximation, the ion drifts at an instant
are specified by the instantaneous accelerations due to
the electric field and other forces affecting the ions and electrons
(modified by the mobilities that depend on the colli-
sion and gyrofrequencies). The electric field, being the solution
of an elliptic equation with coefficients dependent on
the conductivities and external driving terms (like gravity and

the neutral winds), in turn is dependent on the variations of
the plasma density, so the initial condition can be specified
solely in terms of the plasma density. For this we use the
C/NOFS observations to describe the longitudinal (east–west
along the geomagnetic equator) variation of the density, using
specific cases from particular times and dates since each
is unique. Because of the satellite’s low-inclination orbit, its
motion allows it to sample the longitudinal variation of the
plasma density; because it moves quickly compared to the
evolution timescales of the plasma, its sequential sampling
through a time interval can be taken as a snapshot of the variation
through the range of longitudes it visits through that
time. With the orbital speeds of low earth orbit (8 km s−1),
the 1 Hz sampling of the PLP instrument is just about right
for plume models of this kind, which typically have grid
spacings of 4–8 km.
To fully specify the plasma perturbation for the simulation’s
initial condition, however, we need to specify the vari-
ation of the perturbation with altitude and latitude as well.
A linearization of the continuity equation shows that when
the perturbations are small, the altitude variation is proportional
to the altitude gradient of the ambient density. (This
means, for example, that the perturbations are small near the
F layer peak because any displacement of the layer brings
plasma of nearly the same density to that height.) For the latitudinal
variation, we appeal to our climatology and employ
a Gaussian distribution over latitudes about the geomagnetic
equator, with a half-width of 5◦. Thus, we first map out the
perturbations in the equatorial plane, assuming that the dependence
on altitude and longitude can be regarded as sepa-
rable. The longitudinal variation is provided by the satellite
observations while the variation in altitude is specified by the

variation of the absolute value of the derivative of the density
profile with respect to altitude in the equatorial plane,
normalized by the magnitude of the derivative at the satellite
observation point. Then, the variation along the length of
each flux tube crossing the equatorial plane is described by
the Gaussian function of latitude, because we expect the fast
flux-tube-aligned parallel transport to maintain correlation of
densities at points along each flux tube.
We simulate the ionospheric plasma on days 281 and 282
of 2010, near the longitude 280◦. The ambient model of PBMOD
(Retterer, 2005) was run to provide the ambient back-
ground and to evaluate the strength of the RT instability using
the formulas of Sultan (1996) in the ambient plasma density
as determined by PBMOD (Retterer et al., 2005) using the
C/NOFS Ion Velocity Meter (IVM) vertical drifts (Stoneback
et al., 2011) as a driver. Figure 10 shows that the plasma was
mildly unstable on day 281 (minimum exponentiation time
about 21 min) but stable on day 282.
We show the results of the simulation of the irregularities
on the stable day first, in Fig. 11. Six snapshots of the
plasma density at different times are shown here as a function
of east–west distance and altitude in the geomagnetic
equatorial plane. The east–west distances are given in terms
of geographic longitude. The simulation was performed with
a 256 × 256 grid in the equatorial plane, thus with grid cells
about 4 km by 4 km, with 201 points describing the variation
of the density along the magnetic field line in each flux
tube intersecting that plane. Because the density variations
would be too small to discern if the total density were plotted,
we plot here instead the deviation from the mean density
at each altitude, which allows the longitudinal structure of
the small irregularities and their evolution to be seen. The top

left snapshot is the initial condition, specified by the C/NOFS
measurements. Time then advances to the right and then on to
the lower row of snapshots. With the ambient vertical plasma
drift employed in this simulation (note that the density structures
do not rise much in altitude with time), the strength
of the RT growth rate is minimal and, although the irregularities
are amplified by about a factor of two, no rapidly
rising plumes develop. We see the shear in the zonal drift
of the plasma (Zalesak et al., 1982) shape the original vertical
perturbations into the characteristic backward “C” shape.
Other than the modest amplification and some slight diffusive
smoothing and this zonal-drift shear, the density per-
turbations propagate with little modification with time. Note
that periodic boundary conditions are employed in the calculation,
so that, with the eastward zonal drift, as a struc-
ture leaves the simulation on the right side of the box, it
is reintroduced on the left side. Although the amplitude of
the density irregularities remains small, filamentation of the
original density structures into shorter-wavelength features
is apparent at later times in the simulation. The formation
of these roughly 30 km-long irregularities may be caused by
collisional shear instabilities driven by the shear in the neutral
wind and the difference between the wind and the ion
drifts (Hysell and Kudeki, 2004). (Note that although the observations
in Fig. 2 show amplified irregularities later in the
evening, the satellite has moved into a completely different
longitude sector by then, with different stability conditions.)
The results of the simulation of the structure on the unstable
day 281, 2010, are shown in Figs. 12 and 13. Figure 12
shows snapshots of the density perturbations calculated as
done for Fig. 11. Note the rapid increase in the range of the
density variations (about a factor of ten from the initial range)
as the plume develops around 25 UT. These density variations
become strong enough to view in a plot of the total
density (Fig. 13).
The spectrum of density irregularities in the simulations
can be extrapolated into the scale range relevant to interaction
with propagating radio waves to estimate the strength
of scintillation that they can cause (Retterer, 2010b). We
do not expect strong scintillation from these daytime irregularities
because daytime conductivities prevent the occur-
rence of the Rayleigh–Taylor instability, whose nonlinear development
leads to the cascade that strengthens the turbu-
lence at the shorter wavelengths (λ <≈ 1 km) that interact
with radio propagation at relevant frequencies. Weak scintillation
(S4 < 0.4) during the daytime is in fact observed at
the Ancon, Peru site of the US Air Force SCINDA (Scintillation
Decision Aid) network(Groves et al., 1997) on the days
presented here. Daytime F region irregularities that produce
spread-F-like effects have also been observed by radar and
reported by Woodman et al. (1985), Chau and Woodman
(2001), and Shume et al. (2013).
5 Conclusions
In this paper we have shown how important it is to know
the initial perturbation of the ionospheric plasma as well as
the RT growth rate to model the development of equatorial
plasma plumes and the turbulence embedded within them.
There are many possibilities for the source of these initial
perturbations, traveling ionospheric disturbances driven by
atmospheric gravity waves being one of them. But systematic
knowledge of the daytime irregularities has been limited, so
we appealed to observations of densities by the PLP instrument
on the C/NOFS satellite to provide a climatological de-
scription of them.
Using the data, we calculated the mean values of the density
irregularities as a function of altitude, latitude, longi-
tude, local time, season, and phase of solar cycle through
the C/NOFS era: so far, 2008–2012. The next step in the
analysis will be to calculate occurrence probabilities because

23.3 UT on day 282 of 2010 near longitude 280◦ (upper left plot). Time advances looking from left to right, and then continues in the lower
row of plots. Modified by diffusion and shear, these perturbations do not develop into plumes; the plasma was stable at this location and time.
the case studies we presented showed that the daytime irregularities
can be quite variable, being stronger one day
than the next. (We have hesitated to do this so far because
unevenness in sampling is a more difficult problem for
occurrence-percentage calculations than it is for calculations
of mean values.)
Our analysis of the data showed a nearly ubiquitous presence
of density fluctuations in the low-latitude ionosphere
with sufficient amplitude to form reasonable seeds for the
formation of equatorial plumes as these irregularities get amplified
by the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. We used the ir-
regularities observed on two days to seed a plume model to
demonstrate the nature and properties of the mature irregularities
that can form from them, on both stable and RT-
unstable days – the spacings of the plumes, etc. The next
step here would be to perform these calculations for a large
number of days to get a statistical characterization of such
parameters to compare to the observational database. The
near ubiquity of the density fluctuations may explain the success
of calculations of the probability of equatorial plasma
bubbles within the DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite
Program) satellite data set using bubble simulations employing
uniform seeding with longitude and season (Retterer and
Gentile, 2009).
We isolated relatively small (shorter than 300 km) wavelengths
in our separation of finer scales from ambient scales
(to better characterize the local structure of the irregularities).
It has been suggested (Tsunoda, 2005) that very long wavelength
waves are responsible for the seeding, and indeed it
would be possible to extend the present study to look for
these. In fact, the hints of coupling with the lower atmosphere
within the data suggest that it would be interesting
to look for planetary-wave scale variations in the ionospheric
density measurements, which might help explain some of the
long-term variations in scintillation occurrence.
It has recently come to be appreciated that because the spatial
filtering of the upward propagating gravity waves (Fritts
and Vadas, 2008) limits the spectrum of gravity waves that
reach ionospheric heights to those of 100 km wavelengths or
longer, it is practical to conduct a simulation of the whole atmosphere
(Fuller-Rowell et al., 2008) with reasonably sized
grids that permits these waves to affect the ionosphere. Using
these gravity waves to produce the ionospheric disturbances
that can be amplified by plasma instabilities in a plume simulation
(Retterer et al., 2014) removes the need to specify an
artificially imposed initial perturbation altogether. It remains
to be seen whether the variability in irregularity occurrence
produced by this lower-atmospheric driving is sufficient to
explain the observed day-to-day variability of scintillation
occurrence.
