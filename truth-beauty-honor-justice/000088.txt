Abstract. Hydrology has undergone almost transformative
changes over the past 50 years. Huge strides have been made
in the transition from early empirical approaches to rigorous
approaches based on the fluid mechanics of water movement
on and below the land surface. However, progress has been
hampered by problems posed by the presence of heterogeneity,
including subsurface heterogeneity present at all scales.
The inability to measure or map the heterogeneity everywhere
prevented the development of balance equations and
associated closure relations at the scales of interest, and has
led to the virtual impasse we are presently in, in terms of development
of physically based models needed for hydrologic
predictions. An alternative to the mapping of heterogeneity
everywhere is a new Earth system science view, which sees
the heterogeneity as the end result of co-evolutionary hydrological,
geomorphological, ecological, and pedological pro-
cesses, each operating at a different rate, which help to shape
the landscapes that we find in nature, including the heterogeneity
that we do not readily see. The expectation is that
instead of specifying exact details of the heterogeneity in our
models, we can replace it (without loss of information) with
the ecosystem function that they perform. Guided by this new
Earth system science perspective, development of hydrologic
science is now addressing new questions using novel holistic
co-evolutionary approaches as opposed to the physical,
fluid mechanics based reductionist approaches that we inherited
from the recent past. In the emergent Anthropocene, the
co-evolutionary view has expanded further to involve interactions
and feedbacks with human-social processes as well.
In this paper, I present my own perspective of key milestones
in the transformation of hydrologic science from engineering
hydrology to Earth system science, drawn from the work of
several students and colleagues of mine, and discuss their implication
for hydrologic observations, theory development,
and predictions.

1 Introduction
Hydrology has undergone an almost complete transformation
over the past century, from its empirical origins in the early
20th century, to become a fully fledged and key component of
Earth system science by the early 21st century (Chow, 1964;
Sivapalan and Blöschl, 2017). In this paper, I use the precious
opportunity given to me by the European Geosciences
Union, as part of my 2017 Alfred Wegener Lecture, to reflect
on the evolution of the field, as both interested observer
and participant, as well as a student of hydrology for the past
50 years.
I hope that the issues I raise, and the trends and milestones
I recognize in the evolution of the science that I re-
count here, resonate with the experiences of many readers,
even if they might not fully agree with my interpretations
of the events and/or their antecedents. This is one person’s

view of the vast landscape that hydrologists have collectively
traversed, so perspectives abound. This is also not the first
commentary of its kind: indeed, my thinking during my formative
years was guided by the writings of Vit Klemeš and
James Dooge, including their classic papers (Klemeš, 1983,
1986; Dooge, 1986). Their writings have provided unique
perspectives on the field of hydrological science and its evolution
over the past several decades. I hope that by re-telling
this story through the admittedly narrow prism of my own observations
and experience as a catchment hydrologist, I might
be able to provide fresh impetus to early career hydrologists
and new entrants to the field, and encourage them to reflect
on and chart the course of their own future education and
research.
2 Engineering hydrology: legacies of the past to new
beginnings
My earliest introduction to hydrology and later work experience
are probably similar to those of many hydrologists of
my generation, i.e., 1970s vintage, especially those coming
out of engineering schools. Going back in time, 50 years ago
hydrology was mostly non-existent as a subject of study in
many engineering schools (certainly not in Sri Lanka where I
grew up). Most water-related education was then centered on
fluid mechanics, e.g., open channel or river hydraulics, with
a strong focus on applications to irrigation or hydraulic engineering.
In 1972 when I walked into a hydrology class at the
then University of Ceylon (later Sri Lanka), it was taught by
a recent convert from fluid mechanics, who had subsequently
received specialist training in hydrology.
Hydrology education in those days covered three key topics:
infiltration and runoff generation (e.g., SCS curve num-
ber method), the unit hydrograph method to runoff routing,
and the flood frequency curve approach to flood estima-
tion (Linsley et al., 1958). The focus of the training was on
estimation, especially flood estimation (event scale, recipe
style) and the approach was lumped and empirical. Compared
to now, these involved relatively much simpler prob-
lems, framed directly at the catchment scale, and formed
the bread and butter of engineering hydrology, not just in
Sri Lanka, but all over the world. The three building blocks
of engineering hydrology were indeed legacies of three different
previous eras in the growth of the field up until the
1970s (Sivapalan and Blöschl, 2017): empirical era (flood
frequency analysis), rationalization era (SCS curve number
method) and systems era (unit hydrograph method). These
estimation methods remain relevant to this day, very much
the core of engineering hydrology, judging by the popularity
of advanced textbooks such as Chow et al. (1988), which is
still widely used for the training of hydrologists in engineering
schools.
For some of us who were then being trained in mechanics
– solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, soil mechanics, etc.
– the hydrology being taught and practiced using traditional
estimation methods might have appeared strange and even
mysterious. In the early days, I remember being frustrated
that I could not make much physical sense of the cookbook
treatment of the hydrologic estimation procedures, being unable
to connect it to fundamental fluid mechanics principles.
However, there was also wide appreciation for these otherwise
simpler methods that efficiently solved practical prob-
lems of that day and age. In fact, even today’s standard engineering
practice would still be impossible without these sim-
pler approaches.
There was also a profound fascination. How is it possible
that something so inherently complex, as hydrology is, still
comes out so simple (apparently) in practice? Over the years,
there was a grudging realization that perhaps hydrology is
more than about fluid mechanics (Yevjevich, 1968). Indeed,
the search for simplicity in amongst the enormous mechanistic
complexity has been a constant theme in hydrologic
research over the last 50 years (Rodriguez-Iturbe and Valdes,
1979; Sivapalan, 2003; Savenije, 2017). The answer to this
question, we now know in hindsight, is tied up with the issue
of scale (both space and time) and the objects of our study,
catchments, being not simple physical (or mechanical) objects
but complex ecosystems (Gaál et al., 2012), consisting
of component parts that have co-evolved together over time
and are thus co-dependent (Dooge, 1986; Davies, 1992). I
return to this theme throughout this paper.
3 Spatial heterogeneity and scale: promise of
Newtonian mechanics
While the simple black-box methods of engineering hydrology
did solve practical problems efficiently, they had lim-
itations when extrapolating to circumstances beyond those
from which they were developed. For example, what is the
effect of antecedent wetness on runoff generation (Mein and
Larson, 1973)? How does one account for the nonlinearity
of catchment response to the size of rainfall events (Minshall,
1960)? How does one deal with the climatic and ge-
ologic controls when extrapolating flood frequencies to ungauged
catchments (IACWD, 1982)? Also, new and more
complex problems were emerging, such as the effects of land
use changes on streamflows and flooding, and increased concerns
about river water quality, which demanded application
of more process understanding (Woolhiser, 1973). There was
increasing realization that only a recourse to fluid mechanics
and process physics would help address such questions,
bring about needed improvements to the methods and make
them applicable more generally.
Hydrologists thus began to open up the black-box to explicitly
capture space, and to characterize water movement
in catchments through application of physical (fluid mechanics)
principles. The physically based models that were start-
ing to be developed at the time were based on Newtonian meHydrol.

chanics valid at the laboratory or hydrodynamic scale (e.g.,
Richards equation, St.-Venant equations; Chow et al., 1988),
and not at the scale of a catchment. For example, Darcy’s
law embedded in the Richards equation is based on a local
equilibrium assumption to warrant a well-defined potential,
implying that internal mixing in the pore spaces is faster than
external disturbance, but this is only possible at small scales
(Or et al., 2015). This also brought with it the enormous
challenge of specifying the (highly heterogeneous) parameter
values to go with the equations to represent the land-
scape heterogeneity (e.g., subsurface soil formations, surface
features such as micro-topography, macropores, rills and
the stream channel network, and vegetation cover), and the
complexity of the resulting flow processes (Freeze, 1974).
These problems are at the heart of the scale issue, which remains
a major challenge in hydrology in spite of considerable
progress made to date, of which I will speak more later.
A key development in this line of reasoning was Peter
Eagleson’s 1970 book titled Dynamic Hydrology (Eagleson,
1970), which provided a bold theoretical framework for a
new hydrology based on the consistent and rigorous application
of fluid mechanics principles, i.e., Newtonian me-
chanics, along with an appreciation of an organized structure
behind soil, land surface, and vegetation heterogeneity.
Eagleson’s treatment of hydrology was a major departure, a
paradigm shift, away from the lumped, black-box treatment
practiced until then.
Another major milestone was the computer implementation
of the coupled governing equations by Allan Freeze
(Freeze and Harlan, 1969) that framed the catchment hydrologic
modeling problem as a boundary value problem.
Progress in this area was advanced by the increasing availability
of digital terrain information on topography, soils,
vegetation, etc., and computational tools that allowed them to
be processed and visualized (Band and Wood, 1988). These
data allowed the natural heterogeneity of landscapes to be
captured in a more realistic way. Also, it was exciting that
new runoff generation mechanisms such as saturation excess
overland flow and shallow subsurface stormflow were being
discovered in the field (Hewlett and Hibbert, 1967; Dunne
and Black, 1970) and could now be faithfully replicated in
models using the newly available spatial information, e.g.,
digital elevation models (DEMs) (Beven and Kirkby, 1979;
Beven, 1981; Freeze, 1980; Band and Wood, 1988).
3.1 Heterogeneity: to resolve or to parameterize?
The Freeze and Harlan modeling paradigm has remained
in force to this day, and several formal models have been
developed based on the paradigm, such as the SHE model
and variants of the same (Abbott et al., 1986). Due to data
limitations and limits on computing power, early modeling
efforts were restricted to small catchments, and their goal
was limited to generating process understanding, and not so
much to making predictions in real catchments (Stephenson
and Freeze, 1974; Freeze, 1974). Their adoption and use in
real-world applications did not take off for a long time because
of their enormous data needs and insufficient comput-
ing power and also concerns about the appropriateness of
the process physics that could be included in the models at
the model element scale (Beven, 1989; Beven and Germann,
1982; Grayson et al., 1992).
As computing power increased many-fold and the landscapes
began to be mapped at increased resolution for soil,
vegetation and topographic characteristics in many parts of
the world, there has been a revival of sorts in recent times,
with several models being developed and beginning to be applied
to larger (e.g., meso-scale) catchments using more re-
alistic data. Some (of the many) examples include ParFlow
(Kollet and Maxwell, 2008), FIHM (Kumar et al., 2009),
PAWS (Shen and Phanikumar, 2010), and HydroGeoSphere
(Brunner and Simmons, 2012). These modeling efforts are
expanding and I will not be surprised if, before long, such
models are used not just to reproduce field observations, but
also, as in the case of Freeze (1980), to discover and explain
previously unobserved phenomena at all scales.
In recent times, as part of climate change studies, modeling
has been extended to continental and global scales to
serve as the land-surface hydrology components of regional
or global climate models. Because of the large scales, spatial
resolution of such models in the past tended to be very
coarse, on the order of hundreds of kilometers (e.g., bucket
model, Manabe, 1969). However, progress is continually being
made to improve the resolution from hundreds of kilo-
meters to hundreds of meters, helped along by increased
computational power and the availability of terrain information
at finer resolutions (e.g., Community Land Model,
Oleson et al., 2013). There is now a new thrust to improve
the resolution of these models to 30 m for the whole globe
(note: 30 m is the resolution of terrain information globally
available), under the theme of “hyper-resolution modeling”
(Wood et al., 2011; Bierkens, 2015; Wing et al., 2017). Concerns
and debates about the appropriateness of the physics
used in these models, the appropriateness of constitutive relations
being adopted (Loritz et al., 2017), and the resulting
uncertainty in hydrologic predictions, have not gone away,
however (Clement, 2011; Beven and Cloke, 2011; Wood et
al., 2012).
An ostensible reason for going for finer resolution, is of
course, since now we can do it, i.e., with data availability
and computing power, why not, and also since the benefits
of hyper-resolution modeling for both science and prac-
tice are increasingly becoming evident. For example, hyperresolution
models over regional or continental scale domains
can track large-scale storm movements and the resulting impacts
at scales relevant to human wellbeing, as well as gen-
erate insights about large-scale teleconnections between or
within regions (Senatore et al., 2015; Fang and Shen, 2017).
A more immediate reason, however, is that as one improves
the resolution, the (fervent) hope is that all heterogeneity will

disappear and the governing equations used will match the
spatial scales of the processes one is trying to model (e.g.,
Clark et al., 2015, 2017; Peters-Lidard et al., 2017). In reality,
of course, field evidence has strongly indicated that the heterogeneity
does not disappear even if one goes to finer scales,
and there is a limit to how far we can split the landscape to
achieve any desired level of homogeneity and still maintain a
continuum (Beven, 1989; Blöschl and Sivapalan, 1995). Besides,
the presence of macro-pores and other preferred path-
ways (Beven and Germann, 1982), and explicit treatment of
runoff phenomena relating to the “old water, new water” concept
(McDonnell, 1990), present major challenges to tradi-
tional continuum representations of water movement on, and
particularly below, the land surface based on Newtonian mechanics
alone (Beven, 2006). One therefore reaches the al-
ternative conclusion that, whatever grid scale one chooses,
there is no alternative but to parameterize the effects of any
remaining heterogeneity at the sub-grid scale.
The end result for spatially distributed, physically based
models of catchment hydrology is that model development
has been caught between two temptations (Hrachowitz and
Clark, 2017):
1. split the landscape more and more down to the continuum
(hydrodynamic) scale so that heterogeneity disap-
pears as an issue (i.e., heterogeneity is completely resolved);
2. aggregate to some scale at which the effects of hetero-
geneity are taken care of through simplified treatments
with process parameterizations that can account for the
effects of all sub-grid heterogeneity.
Advancing technological capability and increased process
knowledge at small scales are the drivers towards the former
option (Wood et al., 2011). Appreciation of scale ef-
fects, including expectation of simplicity through averaging
(Sivapalan, 2003), and concerns about predictive uncertainty
(Beven and Cloke, 2011) and about a dominant focus on
techniques and other quick fixes (e.g., model–data assimilation)
over the important search for hydrological understand-
ing (Klemeš, 1986), are the key drivers towards the latter
option. The problem of heterogeneity is not unique to hydrology,
and applies to all environmental sciences, and ap-
proaches to mediate the alternative perspectives presented
above may draw inspiration from a quote from ecologist Simon
Levin (1992):
To scale from the leaf to the ecosystem to the
landscape and beyond. . . we must understand how
information is transferred from fine scales, and
vice versa. We must learn how to aggregate and
simplify, retaining essential information without
getting bogged down in unnecessary detail. The
essence of modeling is, in fact, to facilitate the
acquisition of this understanding, by abstracting
and incorporating just enough detail to produce observed
patterns. . . the objective of a model should
be to ask how much detail can be ignored without
producing results that contradict specific sets
of observations, on particular scales of interest.
Levin’s (1992) is an argument for “coarse graining”, i.e.,
formulating models with only the necessary degree of complexity,
and against attempts to fully resolve the enormous
heterogeneity and complexity of hydrologic processes at progressively
smaller timescales and space scales, a perspec-
tive which is echoed by hydrologist Thomas Dunne as well
(Dunne, 1998).
3.2 Organized heterogeneity and preferred space
scales: REA
Inspired by the organization that nature exhibits around a hierarchy
of spatial scales, i.e., hillslope, catchment, region,
etc. (Blöschl and Sivapalan, 1995), there have been concerted
efforts to identify whether a characteristic space scale, which
reflects the spatial organization and can thus serve as the
building block of distributed models, exists in catchment hydrology.
This idea is similar to the continuum or REV con-
cept long used in groundwater hydrology with a considerable
degree of success (Bear, 1972; Hassanizadeh and Gray,
1979). The argument has been that aggregating the governing
equations or process descriptions to this building block
scale might lead to simplified (effective) lumped or continuum
treatments, obviating the need to split the catchment into
smaller elements to capture the effects of heterogeneity. This
way of thinking reflects the long-standing conviction, supported
by observations, that in spite of the enormous com-
plexity of hydrologic processes in landscapes, catchmentscale
hydrologic responses can often be described by sim-
pler models with only a few parameters (Jakeman and Hornberger,
1993; Sivapalan, 2003). Dooge (1986) has argued that
catchments are complex systems with some level of organization,
and indeed “simplicity out of complexity” is a use-
ful property of such complex systems (Davies, 1992). However,
when one opts for the parameterization approach in-
spired by this reasoning, one still needs to know key features
of the underlying heterogeneity, e.g., their statistical
distributions or organizational structure (and not necessarily
the actual observed patterns). Furthermore, we also need to
have information about cross-scale process interactions that
might lead to the simplicity we desire (Dunne and Black,
1970; Hassanizadeh and Gray, 1979), and must utilize efficient
approaches to incorporate them into models through
appropriate model structures and parameterizations (Beven
and Kirkby, 1979; Zehe et al., 2014).
Motivated by this reasoning, Wood et al. (1988) pursued
this scale question in the context of runoff generation responses
at the catchment scale. On the basis of spatial av-
eraging of numerical simulation outcomes from a distributed

rainfall–runoff model of hypothetical catchments, Wood et
al. (1988) postulated that such a spatial scale could exist,
which they called the representative elementary area (REA),
and estimated its size to be about 1 km2 (Fig. 1). Subsequent
field observations and simulations in New Zealand and
Germany supported the idea with some reservations and further
refinements (Woods et al., 1995; Didszun and Uhlen-
brook, 2008). The claims about both the existence and size
of the REA have been questioned by others, based on perceived
limitations of the averaging approach used to resolve
these questions (Fan and Bras, 1995; Blöschl et al., 1995).
A further limitation of the REA of Wood et al. (1988) is
that it focused on surface runoff volume, and not its timing.
Robinson et al. (1995) explored the change in domi-
nant controls on runoff timing (e.g., hydrograph dispersion)
with increased catchment area, and showed that the scale
at which the dispersion is maximally reproduced can be affected
by whether (fast) surface or (slower) subsurface runoff
pathways dominate. The significance of the existence of the
REA, whatever its size, is that it is small enough to still
account for relevant spatial hydrological variations, and yet
large enough to avoid the overwhelming data and parameter
needs of small-scale (distributed) models. As a result, despite
the reservations, the notion of using a representative watershed
scale as the building block towards the development of
distributed models (now at a sub-catchment scale) has remained
as a working hypothesis for organizing our thought
processes in respect of modeling.
Inspired by the possibility that adoption of such a representative
scale might lead to simplified yet physically based
hydrologic prediction models, Reggiani (1999) developed a
new theory of hydrology around this building block, now
named the representative elementary watershed or REW, to
account for some of the limitations of the earlier REA concept.
Reggiani’s theory was expressed in the form of balance
equations for mass, momentum, energy and entropy written
down directly at the scale of the REW (Reggiani et al.,
1998), and an accompanying constitutive theory (Reggiani et
al., 1999) to ensure the theory gives rise to a determinate set
of governing equations. Subsequently, Zehe et al. (2006) derived
soil moisture characteristic (i.e., constitutive) relation-
ships at the REW scale through the upscaling of corresponding
point-scale observations. Likewise, Lee et al. (2007) de-
veloped a set of closure relations for the many boundary
fluxes for the catchment system – between different REWs
and between different sub-regions within each REW – again,
to account for the effects of sub-grid heterogeneity and process
complexity, thus helping to complete the specification
of the governing equations representing the catchment response.
The net advantage of the REW approach is that it ends
up with the solution of a system of coupled ordinary differential
equations (as opposed to a system of partial dif-
ferential equations, which one obtains if they were to split
a catchment into rectangular or triangular elements). Both
Tian et al. (2006) and Lee et al. (2007) developed numerical
schemes to solve these governing equations, thus forming a
new generation of models based on the REW approach that
parallel distributed models based on rectangular or triangular
finite elements following the Freeze and Harlan paradigm.
In this way Tian et al. (2006) and Lee et al. (2007) have
contributed to a new class of models of intermediate complexity,
resolving processes occurring at scales larger than
the size of the REW, and parameterizing those happening at
smaller scales (Beven, 2012). Their potential as a new modeling
framework has also been highlighted through several ap-
plications. For example, models based on the REW approach
have been applied to real catchments, generating space–time
predictions of the rainfall–runoff response for catchments in
Australia (near Darwin, Lee et al., 2007) and in Oklahoma
in the United States (Li et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2012). In
recent years, these models have been extended to make distributed
predictions of sediment and nutrient transport and
export at the catchment scale and across the corresponding
stream networks (Patil et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2012). It should
be noted that in spite of this success, the REW approach has
still not taken off, nor has it been widely adopted as would
be expected, due to the lack of progress in the development
of constitutive and closure relations to account for the effects
of sub-REW heterogeneity and process complexity in catchments
everywhere; this is discussed next.
4 Catchments as ecosystems: limits of Newtonian
mechanics
In spite of its promise, and in spite of the progress made so
far, the REW approach shares the as yet unsolved problem
confronted by all distributed models, which is how to derive
or estimate parameters a priori at the scale of the chosen
grid (in this case, the REW) without first fully resolving subwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/22/1665/2018/

grid heterogeneity and process complexity, which was the key
problem in the first place. The spatial heterogeneity and the
resulting cross-scale process interactions can introduce enormous
complexity and richness to catchment hydrological re-
sponses. However, processes can become even more complex
when we extend the analysis to include multiple timescales.
When we attempt to make predictions over longer timescales,
i.e., longer than events (e.g., months or years), the media
within which hydrologic processes operate (i.e., soils, topography,
vegetation) may themselves change dynamically or
transform permanently (e.g., time-variant macroporosity due
to the life cycle of earthworms, Zehe and Sivapalan, 2009;
soil swelling and cracking, Savenije and Hrachowitz, 2017).
In other words these are not inert objects fixed for all time, as
is commonly assumed in deterministic models. Furthermore,
if the hydrologic prediction problem is deemed a boundary
value problem, as it often is, it also means that the location of
the boundary and its condition itself are not fixed, but evolve
dynamically as part of the water dynamics, the very dynamics
we are trying to predict (see Fig. 2). The end result is
that the hydrologic response can no longer be described by
Newtonian mechanics alone, and is now the emergent outcome
of two dynamic, coupled processes: water flow itself
and the changes to the media, both occurring over multiple
timescales (Gaál et al., 2012). Note that all of the complex
spatial processes we talked about operate in the time domain
as well.
The most obvious example of a catchment subsystem
that evolves dynamically is vegetation, which is directly involved
in the crucial process of evapotranspiration. Vegeta-
tion adapts itself dynamically over multiple timescales in response
to changing climate and hydrology, even as it has an
impact on the hydrology. Also, over much longer timescales
it can modify the environment around it (e.g., soil structure,
macro-pores, and topography, to name a few). In this way the
temporal dynamics of vegetation can also indirectly impact
runoff generation processes. As well as evolving with the dynamic
hydrology, such biologic activity renders the system
even more internally dynamic. The adaptations of vegetation
and their modifications of landscapes may be governed by biological
or ecological processes, and cannot be captured by
universal descriptions based on Newtonian mechanics that
focus on flow processes alone; presently their effects on flow
can only be described by empirical, place-based relationships.
As in the case of spatial upscaling problems discussed
before, it is always tempting to ask the question whether the
temporal organization of a catchment’s hydrologic response,
arising from vegetation adaptations to the multi-scale temporal
variability of climate and hydrology, and the resulting
landscape modifications, could also be averaged to produce a
simplified description of catchment response. This question
is explored next by highlighting different examples of vegetation
(and even landscape) adaptations to natural climate
variability and hydrology.

4.1 Adaptation strategies by vegetation
Understanding vegetation adaptation processes is a rich and
multifaceted problem, but here I will use examples from my
own modeling experience to only illustrate the point about
simplicity in spite of complexity, and how this might arise
as a result of vegetation adaptations in the time domain.
Many existing catchment models, including the ones mentioned
before, approximate evapotranspiration rates by vege-
tation (e.g., forests, grasses) as if they function like humanengineered
agricultural crops; i.e., they transpire at a poten-
tial rate (e.g., potential evaporation) when the soil is wet, and
reduce their evapotranspiration rate when soil moisture falls
below the saturation value. In reality, this is not normally the
case under native vegetation, and such approximations can
lead to serious discrepancies when evapotranspiration is a
large fraction of annual water balance, as is the case in most
dry places around the world (Sivapalan et al., 1996; Thompson
et al., 2011a). This was highlighted in the Darling Range
region of south-western Western Australia during field experiments
carried out by Silberstein et al. (2001).
South-western Western Australia experiences a strong
Mediterranean climate, with warm dry summers and cold
wet winters. Field measurements made by Silberstein et
al. (2001) in a forested catchment in this region showed that
daily evapotranspiration rate (bare soil evaporation plus transpiration)
was roughly 2.5 mm day−1 during a 2-week pe-
riod in the wet winter phase of the experiment. Remarkably,
when the experiment was repeated 6 months later during a
2-week period following a very dry summer, the evapotranspiration
rate turned out to be very much the same, about
2.5 mm day−1 every day. The assumption that trees, like agricultural
crops, might reduce their transpiration rates during
dry periods (due to their experiencing water stress) was found
not to be the case. It turned out that native Eucalyptus trees in
this part of Western Australia have adapted to the strong seasonality
of climate (hot dry summers and cold wet winters)
by growing dynamic deep roots that tap into a groundwater
aquifer present that is over 30 m deep. Indeed, it was found
that tree roots remained always in contact with the deep water
table even when the latter fluctuated between summer
and winter and between years. The net result is an apparently
constant transpiration response by the vegetation, i.e.,
2.5 mm day−1 every day.
In a subsequent study at a site near Darwin, in Northern
Territory, Australia, Schymanski (2007) reported an al-
together different response by native vegetation. This area
experiences a monsoon climate, with a wet 4-month period
of heavy monsoon rains, followed by 8 months of dry
(non-rainy) conditions. Being tropical, potential evaporation
is uniformly high during both periods. Water table is
present at a depth of about 10 m all year. Schymanski reported
that measured total evapotranspiration rate appeared
to follow the variation of surface soil wetness, regardless of
the energy available, i.e., potential evaporation (Schymanski,
2007). However, the adaptation strategy by the prevail-
ing vegetation was different. In Darwin, the more permanent,
deep-rooted trees tap into the groundwater table, just
as in Western Australia, and were found to transpire at a
rate of 1 mm day−1 all year, regardless of surface soil moisture.
However, in addition, during the wet season, a dense
under-story of grasses develops which, like crops, transpires
at rates proportional to the surface soil moisture: a peak of
2.5–3.0 mm day−1 during the wet season, decreasing as the
soil dries during the subsequent dry season, and dropping
to negligible values as the grasses completely senesce and
dry out. Once again, a slightly more complex, almost predictable
transpiration pattern that arises via complex adapta-
tion strategies adopted by the vegetation to the climate and
hydrology.
Two different places, two different adaptation strategies by
vegetation that has developed in each setting, yet permitting
a simplified transpiration pattern in each case: in both cases,
the strategies used by the vegetation are different from what
is normally assumed for agricultural crops. This raises two
issues: if one wants to develop a predictive model of evapotranspiration
for a specific place, then the adaptation strat-
egy adopted by the vegetation that develops locally must be
known a priori. Newtonian theory by itself cannot predict
the vegetation and its adaptation strategy one is likely to encounter
in a given place, both of which may be governed by
(the as yet unknown) biological/ecological laws at the scales
of interest to us. The adaptation strategy adopted by the vegetation
would be relatively easy to determine, given the kind of
observational evidence available to Silberstein et al. (2001)
or Schymanski (2007). Few places would have that kind of
field evidence, however. In a catchment context, many more
places will have rainfall–runoff data only, from which the
adaptation strategy adopted by vegetation may have to be inferred
(with a lot more ambiguity, given the kind of limited
data, especially in the absence of evapotranspiration data).
The fact that prevailing vegetation in different places may use
different adaptation strategies, in the absence of such supporting
data, also opens the way for much freedom or plu-
ralism in the development of predictive models, as opposed
to a universal model that would be expected from Newtonian
mechanics.
4.2 Ecosystem function and data-based inference
A key observation from the last section is that the dynamics
of evapotranspiration is intimately connected to that of
vegetation adaptation. We can broaden this argument to include
other catchment responses as well, such as runoff. We
are quite used to treating runoff generation as a physical
process, governed by Newtonian mechanics (Larsen et al.,
1994). This presumes that we know a priori what mechanism
of runoff generation dominates in a given place. However,
Newtonian mechanics alone may not be able to determine a
priori (i.e., without field evidence) the dominant runoff genwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/22/1665/2018/
Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 1665–1693, 2018

eration mechanism in any given place. Based on field evidence
Dunne (1978) provided a perspective on climate, soil,
topography and vegetation controls on dominant runoff generation
mechanisms, popularly known as the Dunne diagram.
To this day, the Dunne diagram has continued to defy explanations
based on Newtonian mechanics alone (Larsen et
al., 1994; Li et al., 2014). Vegetation adaptation may again
be the chief cause of this phenomenon, e.g., vegetation perhaps
adapting itself and adapting the environment around it
(i.e., soils, topography) in such a way that it can retain soil
moisture longer in arid environments and drain water sooner
in wet environments. Also, forest soils are known to have
higher surface infiltration capacities, which also impact their
stormflow response. Thus, “forest” vegetation type becomes
a property linked to infiltration and runoff generation, as well
as to evapotranspiration.
Given this field evidence on evapotranspiration and runoff
generation, and given the limitations of the more reductionist
approach based on Newtonian mechanics, one is tempted to
look for a complementary but holistic approach that can accommodate
the adaptation of catchment properties (i.e., veg-
etation, soils) to environmental conditions. What if, instead
of treating catchments as physical or mechanical systems,
we consider them more broadly as ecosystems. Then the
same processes, i.e., evapotranspiration and runoff generation,
could be deemed a catchment’s ecological responses, as
part of its overall ecosystem “function”. This was the wisdom
behind the “functional” approach proposed by Black (1997),
who framed a catchment’s hydrological responses to precipitation
more broadly as partition, storage, transmission, and
release (see also Wagener et al., 2007), as opposed to pointscale
processes (e.g., infiltration), in this way aligning them
to the catchment’s ecosystem function.
Another observation from the last section is that in spite
of the known complexity of hydrologic processes at small
timescales (rain events) and space (point) scales, which Newtonian
mechanics may well be able to capture under some
circumstances, catchment organization and ecosystem adaptation
impart a level of simplification to hydrological re-
sponses at the catchment scale. One example is the dynamics
of evapotranspiration seen in forested catchments in Perth
and Darwin. Another example is the well-known fact that the
discharge of the groundwater aquifer to streams can often
be represented by simple linear reservoir theory, characterized
by a mean residence time, in spite of the known com-
plexity of flow processes operating at small scales, governed
by Darcy’s law (Savenije, 2017). This intriguing connection
between micro-scale complexity and macro-scale simplicity
has been an unsolved problem in catchment hydrology
(Dooge, 1986; Sivapalan, 2003). The challenge for predictions
is that the mechanisms through which such transforma-
tions from complexity to simplicity happen are largely unknown.
If the biological or ecological laws or principles that
govern them at the catchment scale were known, we might
then use them to derive simpler, holistic parameterizations
of hydrologic responses. Until such laws become available
and lead to the development of universal predictive models,
however, the problem lends itself to a plurality of modeling
ideas, including data-driven approaches that rely on inferences
from available rainfall–runoff data.
Wittenberg and Sivapalan (1999) presented an interesting
and insightful implementation of the data-driven inference
idea. They performed diagnostic analysis of rainfall–runoff
data in several catchments in Western Australia (WA). This
first involved analysis of streamflow recessions (i.e., following
the end of individual rainfall events) during different
times of the year, and in WA’s seasonal climate, attributing
differences in the slopes of the recession curves to changing
evapotranspiration (ET) within the year. This made it possible
to back-calculate the unknown ET from the recession
curve slopes, and thus piece together a simple groundwater
balance model for the catchments. This approach to databased
inference was later extended by Kirchner (2009) to
UK catchments, calling the approach “doing hydrology backwards”.
In both cases, however, the power of the approach
was due to the apparent simplicity of the hydrologic response
manifesting itself at the catchment scale, which results from
the spatial landscape organization and the temporal adaptation
of the catchment ecosystem to the prevailing climatic
variability.
Following the lead of Wittenberg and Sivapalan, Jothityangkoon
et al. (2001) and Atkinson et al. (2002) ex-
tended the data-based inference idea further by treating the
catchment’s observed rainfall–runoff response as a reflection
of its ecosystem functions (i.e., partition, storage, trans-
mission, and release) but manifesting differently at different
timescales. They assumed that the ecosystem functions are
reflected collectively in several runoff signatures (i.e., temporal
patterns extracted from streamflow data at different
timescales), through which it was assumed that the catchment
reveals its internal dynamics or functioning (see Fig. 3).
These streamflow signatures, e.g., the regime curve (monthly
timescale), flow duration curve (daily), or flood frequency
curve (multiple timescales), are thus seen as outward manifestations
of internal ecosystem functioning, and can there-
fore be deemed emergent (temporal) patterns.
The functional insight and the realization that catchment
responses can show organization along timescales gave rise
to a new approach to the modeling of catchment rainfall–
runoff responses, called the top–down or downward approach
(Klemeš, 1983; Sivapalan et al., 2003). We might as
well call it the functional approach, following the lead of
Black (1997). This modeling approach is diametrically opposed
but complementary to the bottom–up or upward ap-
proach to model development based on Newtonian mechanics
(Klemeš, 1983), an example of which is the REW ap-
proach of Reggiani et al. (1998, 1999) discussed earlier. The
idea behind the downward or functional approach is to develop
models step by step, but starting at long timescales
(e.g., the annual timescale, as in the case of Jothityangkoon
Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 1665–1693, 2018 www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/22/1665/2018/

et al., 2001). Once a simple (simplest possible) model is
developed that reproduces the runoff signature at the annual
scale, i.e., inter-annual variability, one then moves down
to the monthly timescale, and adds just enough functional
complexity to the model to match a new signature, now at
the monthly timescale, i.e., the regime curve. If partitioning
is the main function that is accommodated at the annual
timescale, storage and release could be functions added at
the monthly scale, and so on. This process continues until
a model is developed that is able to reproduce signatures extracted
from streamflow data simultaneously at all timescales
(Jothityangkoon et al., 2001; Atkinson et al., 2002). The top–
down modeling approach bears some similarity to the databased
mechanistic modeling approach proposed earlier by
Peter Young of Lancaster University, and illustrated in Young
and Beven (1994) and Young (2003), as discussed in Sivapalan
and Young (2005).
Interestingly, the “functional” models, developed in a top–
down way through inference from data (e.g., Jothityangkoon
et al., 2001; Atkinson et al., 2002), are in many ways similar
to what have long been known as conceptual models,
which have been developed from the 1960s, beginning with
the Stanford Watershed Model (Crawford and Linsley, 1966).
These conceptual model types can be lumped (at the catchment
scale) or distributed (at the sub-catchment scale), and
are also developed without recourse to Newtonian mechanics.
Examples (among numerous other models) include the
Tank Model (Sugawara, 1967), HBV (Bergström, 1976),
LASCAM (Sivapalan et al., 1996), and the FLEX generation
of models proposed in recent times (Fenicia et al., 2011;
Gharari et al., 2011). Both conceptual and top–down model
types take the form of a combination of inter-connected storage
reservoirs that mimic the functioning of different parts of
a catchment, both attempt to provide some kind of mapping
between landscape structure and model structure (Sivapalan,
2005), and both types contain strong subjective elements.
The main difference is the thought process that goes into
developing these models. Development of top–down models
follows a systematic procedure to decipher the model
structure from observed rainfall–runoff variability at multiple
timescales. In the case of traditional conceptual models, the
model structure is chosen, ostensibly but often arbitrarily, to
reflect the functioning of parts of the catchment, with the opportunity
to further refine it through calibration or confronta-
tion with rainfall–runoff observations. In another sense, both
model types are also similar to physically based models of intermediate
complexity arising from the REW approach (e.g.,
Tian et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2007), in that all three model
structures are expressed in the form of coupled ordinary differential
equations that reflect water balances of individual
compartments (or storages).

5 Newtonian mechanics vs. ecosystem function:
impasse and reconciliation
In the preceding sections I outlined two complementary approaches
that hydrologists have pursued over the past 5
decades to make catchment-scale predictions. Using the terminology
of Klemeš (1983), subsequently expanded by Siva-
palan et al. (2003), these can be termed the upward (or
bottom–up reductionist) and downward (top–down ecosystem
or functional) approaches. The upward approach fun-
damentally involves application of Newtonian mechanics,
either through spatially distributed models that attempt to
explicitly resolve spatial heterogeneity, or through semidistributed
(e.g., REW) models that attempt to parameterize
the effects of sub-grid heterogeneity, while keeping the essential
physics. The downward approach to model develop-
ment, on the other hand, involves making inferences from
catchment-scale rainfall–runoff data (and other responses,
e.g., evapotranspiration, if available).
The advantage of Newtonian mechanics based models is
that the role of spatial gradients in controlling hydrologic
processes, at least in principle, can be explicitly captured,
and so the fidelity of process descriptions at small scales
can be guaranteed (at least in principle). However, they have
the disadvantage that they cannot (yet) account for the functioning
of the catchment as an ecosystem, which is defined
by process interactions in the time domain, the biological/ecological
laws behind which are yet to be discovered
in the catchment hydrologic context and incorporated into
the models. The top–down approach to modeling has the advantage,
being derived from rainfall–runoff data, that it can
capture the holistic nature of catchment functioning. On the
other hand, it cannot (yet) unambiguously account for the
physical laws that govern flow processes in landscapes, especially
in the spatial domain.
Indeed, it has been said that “bottom–up reductionisttype
models are best suited to represent “known” knowl-
edge, and are at their weakest to reveal “unknown” knowledge
(R. Silberstein, personal communication, 2017); vice
versa for top–down ecosystem-type models. In this sense, the
biggest strength of the top–down approach is also the biggest
drawback of the bottom–up approach, and vice versa (Sivapalan
et al., 2003). These two perspectives will remain ir-
reconcilable until major breakthroughs are made in our understanding
of multi-scale spatial heterogeneity and tempo-
ral variability, no doubt governed by Newtonian mechanics at
small scales, the resulting cross-scale interactions and adaptations
at long timescales governed by ecological laws, and
the understanding of how these contribute to whole ecosystem
function and manifest themselves in more holistic and
simplified parameterizations of catchment responses (Sivapalan,
2005; McDonnell et al., 2007). Presently, in this con-
text, we are at an impasse.
One of the clearest manifestations of the impasse in modeling
is in the uncertainty in the resulting hydrologic predic-

to discovery and explanation of emergent phenomena at the higher
level. Taken from Sivapalan (2005).
tions (Beven and Binley, 1992). Neither approach is complete
in terms of its theoretical foundation to generate the
predictions we need. In the case of bottom–up models based
on Newtonian mechanics, the predictive uncertainty arises
from an inability to characterize the heterogeneity of landscape
properties accurately, the lack of complete knowledge
or understanding of hydrologic processes in the real world,
and the inability to capture them in the models. In the case
of top–down or functional models that depend on data-based
inference, equally there is uncertainty arising from the diversity
of catchment adaptations to climate and consequently in
the plurality of model structures. In addition, there is further
uncertainty due to the inability to unambiguously esti-
mate the parameters through calibration, in the absence of
physical guidance or universal laws to constrain the parameter
values. In a broad sense, the uncertainty arises from both
inadequate understanding of catchment behavior (epistemic
uncertainty) and an inability to characterize catchment heterogeneity
fully (aleatory uncertainty) (Beven, 2016). Fur-
ther progress in modeling will thus depend on our ability to
break the impasse between these two different modeling approaches
by changing the science questions that have been
behind hydrologic research over the past decades (Sivapalan,
2009).
5.1 Breaking the impasse: change the question
True reconciliation, however, is unlikely to come about if
we stay within the existing paradigms, through mere refinements
to existing approaches to estimation and prediction.
Reconciliation between Newtonian mechanics and ecosystem
function based approaches will require a new era of re-
search aimed at explanation and discovery rather than estimation
and prediction (see also Burt and McDonnell, 2015).
Reconciliation will require, on the one hand, that we understand
the functional role of landscape heterogeneity, and on
the other hand, the physics (i.e., mechanics or thermodynamics)
underpinning ecosystem function. This might require go-

ing beyond Newtonian mechanics and searching for other
universal laws or organizing principles that explain ecosystem
functioning of catchments in particular places. Instead of
parameterizing the effects of heterogeneity, the focus should
be on recognizing it as an emergent pattern and coming up
with explanations to describe how it came about and discover
its ecosystem function (Fig. 4, Sivapalan, 2005). The modeling
question should no longer be whether we can explicitly
account for the effects of heterogeneity mechanistically, but
whether its ecosystem function can be reproduced (McDonnell
et al., 2007; Schaefli et al., 2011). In other words, to
move forward towards both understanding and improved predictions,
research goals and associated scientific questions
must broaden from just estimation to explanation.
5.2 Moving from estimation to explanation: focus on
phenomena
As we have seen, the focus on estimation goes back to the
beginnings of engineering hydrology. In spite of the enormous
progress we have made in our ability to make predic-
tions, these advances have not contributed towards generalized
theories that operate universally across catchments and
places. General theories are very much needed to bring about
the reconciliation of the diversity of modeling approaches we
now have and achieve a unification of the field. Hydrologic
research will thus have turn to new types of questions (Sivapalan,
2009), which are focused on explanation and discov-
ery, perhaps as a necessary prelude to prediction. Organization
of catchment responses and the patterns of ecosystem
function that one observes in the real world are no longer objects
to be mimicked by our models (“grist to the calibration
mill”, à la hydrograph fitting), but need to be seen as emergent
phenomena. The enormous computational power and
data availability that we now have should be utilized to discover
and/or explain previously unobserved or unexplained
phenomena at all scales and places (Li et al., 2014; Dunne,
1978). This may herald a major culture change in the way we
do research.
Phenomena abound in hydrology, differing in complexity
and richness, and arising in different contexts, which warrants
a separate review article by itself, given their increas-
ing importance in hydrology research. Examples of phenomena
in catchment hydrology include the old water-new wa-
ter concept (McDonnell, 1990), the pan evaporation paradox
(Roderick and Farquhar, 2004), the Budyko hypothesis
(Budyko, 1974), the proportionality hypothesis that lies behind
the success of the SCS-curve number method (Wang et
al., 2014), and the linear reservoir approximation to groundwater
contributions to streamflow (Savenije, 2017). The goal
of research will increasingly revolve around coming up with
plausible hypotheses about their causes and testing them out
through further observations or targeted modeling. If the explanations
hold in several places, then it contributes to ac-
cumulation of knowledge and understanding, and eventually
to general theories and underlying organizing princi-
ples. There is a long history in other branches of hydrology
where such a focus on phenomena has led to major advances
in hydrologic understanding. One can point as examples the
phenomenon of macrodispersion in groundwater transport in
heterogeneous porous media (Gelhar and Axness, 1983) and
that of hysteresis in vadose zone hydrology (Hassanizadeh
et al., 2002), where sound explanations were found while remaining
within the Newtonian and/or thermodynamic frame-
works.
Until recently, under the weight of the dominant estimation/prediction
(i.e., hydrograph fitting) paradigm, inad-
equate attention has been given to the study of phenomena in
catchment hydrology. Here I will illustrate, through two simple
examples, how the physical or functional causes of phe-
nomena can be explored, and how this might contribute to
generalized understanding. The two examples I present here
involve an apparent power-law relationship with catchment
size (area). The first one involves annual maximum flood
peak (scaled by catchment area), in this case, taken from
several nested catchments in the Appalachian region of the
United States (Fig. 5a: Smith, 1992; Robinson and Sivapalan,
1997; Sivapalan, 2005). The second one involves a sediment
delivery ratio (the fraction of eroded sediment at an event
scale that actually reaches the catchment outlet; Fig. 5b: Lu
et al., 2005). Even though these examples are obtained from
specific places, the phenomena themselves are universally
observed. The question is, why is it a power law? Is there
a causal explanation? Answers to such questions test our understanding
of the underlying processes and the interpreta-
tion of observations of all kinds.
Robinson and Sivapalan (1997) showed that the observed
power law can be explained by a simple argument, supported
by a simple linear “bucket” model with two differ-
ent timescales (event duration, and a mean response time
that is a function of catchment area, due to the geometric
relationship between length of travel and area), and an understanding
of rainfall variability. If rainfall intensity is a
constant during a single storm event, the magnitude of the
flood peak can be analytically derived based on storm duration
and mean response time: it does not follow the power
law (see the dotted line. . . in Fig. 5a). Firstly, the introduction
of within-storm rainfall variability increases the flood
peak for small catchments (due to their fast response), but
has no impact in large catchments (denoted by the symbol
“∗∗∗” in the figure). Secondly, the introduction of betweenevent
interactions and seasonality increases the flood peak
for large catchments (due to their effect on antecedent conditions),
but has no influence for small catchments (denoted by
o o o). Their combination leads to a combination of the two
effects (denoted by - - - and —): flood peak is increased for
small catchments (because of within-storm variability) and
for large catchments (because of interaction between events
and/or seasonality). So what looks like a power law is really
an emergent pattern that falls out as a result of a complex inwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/22/1665/2018/

terplay across different timescales, and the geometry of the
catchment’s organization.
The scaling of the sediment delivery ratio is an even more
complex phenomenon to explain (with considerable scatter;
see Fig. 5b), because it involves not only runoff processes
as discussed above, but also sediment transport processes.
Even in this case, however, Lu et al. (2005) proposed an explanation
that was similar, indeed one that followed that of
Robinson and Sivapalan (1997). Lu et al. too used a simple
conceptual model that consisted of two linear stores arranged
in series: a hillslope store that addresses transport of sediment
to the nearest streams and a channel store that addresses
sediment routing in the channel network. They showed analytically
that, as with Robinson and Sivapalan (1997), the
spatial scaling of the sediment delivery ratio (as an emergent
pattern) can be explained, to first order, in terms of the interactions
between several timescales (i.e., storm duration, hill-
slope/channel travel times, and two depositional timescales),
and also catchment geometry as before.
I used these simple examples to also highlight the effects
of the interactions between multi-scale temporal variability
of both climate inputs and catchment response, and how they
tend to generate emergent patterns due to the resonance that
is generated through these interactions, even in the absence
of adaptations of vegetation or catchment properties. In other
words, the way that the catchment responds to a sequence of
events is different from the way it responds to a single event,
indicating that the response of the catchment must be considered
holistically across multiple timescales. The impor-
tance of timescale interactions has also been highlighted in
other contexts to explain several environmental phenomena:
power-law-type streamflow recessions resulting from landscape
heterogeneity (Harman and Sivapalan, 2009); the ef-
fect of rainfall event variability on the pesticide leaching risk
of groundwater (McGrath et al., 2010); and climate controls
on vadose zone contaminant transport (Harman et al., 2011).
This issue will be explored in more detail in later sections
using an expanded, co-evolutionary framework.
5.3 Towards explanation and extrapolation: new kinds
of models, new kinds of phenomena
As the focus turns from estimation to explanation, the types
of models one uses may also need to change. It is not an
accident that in the two examples discussed above, I have
demonstrated how simple models are able to provide firstorder
explanations of otherwise complex phenomena. In this
age of big data, data mining and hyper-resolution modeling
(Wood et al., 2011; Peters-Lidard et al., 2017), one might be
surprised that I advocate the use of simple models. I do this
deliberately because the focus here is not on prediction of the
complete system response in one place with all its gory complexity,
but as per the Einstein quote below (see the earlier
quote from Simon Levin), on the ability to explain complex,
possibly universal phenomena more simply, and thus contribute
to accumulation of knowledge and understanding.
If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand
it well enough. – Albert Einstein
Note that the simplicity I advocate here is, in the words of
James Dooge, a “search for. . . a rational simplicity, not the
simplicity of crude assumptions,. . . or assuming the difficulty
out of the way” (Dooge, 1995). In the spirit of the top–down
reasoning, as also argued by Dooge (1995), we will be better
off starting with simple models targeted on the phenomenon
of interest, not models of everything, and increasing the complexity
only as needed. Dooge suggested linearization and
similarity analysis as effective ways to simplify models and
gain understanding of phenomena, which was also the case
in the previously highlighted work of Robinson and Sivapalan
(1997) and Lu et al. (2005).

 M. Sivapalan: Milestones in the transformation of hydrologic science 1677
Phenomena of interest to us can be dynamics (temporal
patterns) in a single place and on a range of timescales
(Burt and McDonnell, 2015). Similarly, in the space domain,
phenomena can be spatial patterns in a single place (within
a catchment, Blöschl et al., 2016) or spatial patterns between
places (catchments) or scales (as in the two examples
above), extending all the way to regional or global patterns
(Blöschl et al., 2013). Increasingly, as discussed before, the
focus turns towards developing a generalized understanding
of whole catchment responses and ecosystem functioning,
and the discovery of universal laws. Therefore, it is no longer
sufficient to study phenomena relating to a single place or
a few places. Increasingly, the phenomena of interest to us
will come from simultaneous observations in many different
places with different histories of the kinds of timescale interactions
shown to be critical in the two examples presented
above (Hipsey et al., 2015), and the synthesis of data collected
from across places, scales and processes (Blöschl et
al., 2013).
6 Timescale interactions and catchment co-evolution:
the Darwinian approach
Understanding the reasons for differences in required model
structure between catchments, including the controls of climate
and landscape properties, may be a good starting point
in the search for more generalized understanding, by drawing
from many different places with different histories. Atkinson
et al. (2002) and Farmer et al. (2003) implemented the
top–down modeling approach, in a comparative way, to two
dozen catchments around Australia and New Zealand. They
found systematic variations in model structure, with the differences
reflecting differences in climate and in how vegeta-
tion and soils may have adapted to the climate. The modeling
studies indicated evidence of a hierarchy of required model
structures, with changing timescales (i.e., annual, monthly,
daily), and with changing aridity. For example, the required
model complexity increased with decreasing timescales, and
increased with increasing aridity. The argument could thus be
made that the required model structure, reflecting the functioning
of a catchment, is itself an emergent property in terms
of how the catchment has adapted itself to the prevailing climate
and geology.
6.1 Catchments “marching to a different drummer”:
comparative hydrology
In order to shed more light on the required level of model
complexity, Jothityangkoon and Sivapalan (2009) compared
a dozen catchments from all around Australia and New
Zealand, using the same top–down modeling approach described
above (i.e., matching streamflow signatures on a
range of timescales). They carried out a diagnostic analysis in
each catchment that focused on elucidating the climate controls
on one particular signature, i.e., inter-annual variability
of runoff. In particular, the authors were interested in discovering
the aspect of the within-year rainfall variability (i.e.,
storminess, seasonality) that may have a dominant control on
the observed inter-annual runoff variability. The diagnostic
analysis adopted involved running calibrated top–down hydrological
models in each catchment, but now with artificial
rainfall inputs that included storminess and seasonality separately,
before being combined. The outputs from the model in
each catchment, for each of the artificial climate inputs, were
compared to the observed inter-annual variability. The question
pursued was: what combination of within-year climate
variability (seasonality, storminess) is needed to reproduce
the observed inter-annual variability of runoff?
The study found that in catchments in Queensland in
north-eastern Australia, inter-annual variability of runoff was
most sensitive to storminess (not seasonality), whereas in
catchments in Western Australia and South Australia, seasonality
was the feature that contributed most to the observed
inter-annual variability. This finding is remarkable, in that
the climate of Queensland is indeed dominated by storminess
(i.e., a small number of large storms), and the climates
of South and Western Australia were indeed dominated by
strong seasonality. The outcomes from these diagnostic analyses
thus indicated that the water balance dynamics of catch-
ments (i.e., model structure and parameters inferred from
the data in a top–down way) somehow “resonate” with the
dominant within-year variability, i.e., storminess in Queensland
and seasonality in Western Australia. In other words,
and paraphrasing American naturalist Henry David Thoreau,
these results indicated that each catchment is “marching to
a different drummer”, the drummer being the variability of
climate drivers present in a given place.
If a (wo)man does not keep pace with (her)his companions,
perhaps it is because (s)he hears a dif-
ferent drummer. Let (her)him step to the music
which (s)he hears, however measured or far away.
– adapted from Henry David Thoreau: Walden,
1854.
The modeling results also reaffirm the ecosystem or functional
view presented earlier, including the argument that
there is much to be gained by making inferences from observed
rainfall–runoff time series. The results also raise the
hope that a more universal understanding of both ecosystem
function and catchment response and their relationship with
climate and geology may be gained by repeating these modeling
and diagnostic studies simultaneously in many more
catchments around the world, in a comparative way, across
gradients of climate and geology. This leads to the notion of
comparative hydrology, first introduced by Falkenmark and
Chapman (1989), and defined more broadly in the next section
by linking it to catchment co-evolution.

6.2 Catchment co-evolution and Earth system science:
a Darwinian view
Berghuijs et al. (2014) extended the above comparative hydrology
approach to the modeling of seasonal water balances
of over 400 catchments across the continental United States.
On the basis of these modeling results they came up with
a classification of observed seasonal water balances (i.e.,
regime curve, a key signature of runoff variability), expressed
in terms of three driving factors: climate aridity, seasonality
(i.e., relative timing of the precipitation within a year),
and the fraction of snow as precipitation. On the basis of
this similarity analysis, they identified 10 dominant catchment
classes among the 400-odd catchments. Not surpris-
ingly, they found a geographic aspect to the locations of the
10 classes, in that they were clustered geographically, influenced
by the slow climatic and geologic variations across the
continent. In addition they found that similarity of seasonal
water balances carried over to have an imprint on betweenclass
differences in several other signatures of runoff vari-
ability, such as the flow duration curve or flood frequency
curve, and yet there was also considerable within-class variability
due to other climatic and landscape factors.
An even more interesting finding from Berghuijs et
al.’s (2014) results, however, was that the regional mapping
of catchments on the basis of similarity of seasonal water
balances was closely aligned with the regional mapping of
not only vegetation classes and ecoregions (i.e., the different
ways ecologists map vegetation and ecosystems), but
also soil orders. This clearly indicated that the seasonal water
balance response is not just about the partitioning of in-
coming precipitation into spatially resolved hydrologic processes,
i.e., runoff, evaporation and storage change. In fact, it
is both a contributor to, and an outcome of, the co-evolution
of physical, biological and pedologic processes governing
vegetation establishment and adaptation, and soil formation,
as well as water balance, which all together reflect an underlying
ecosystem function. Indeed, it is well known in the eco-
logical literature that it is the seasonal water balance that determines
vegetation types that become established in a given
place, including their functioning and productivity (Stephenson,
1990; Robinson et al., 2012).
One can speculate therefore that the phenomenon of each
catchment “marching to a different drummer” is a reflection
of vegetation adapting to (and in turn changing) the environment
around it (e.g., hydrology, soils), in response to the fluc-
tuating water and energy supply at any place of interest (Sivapalan
and Blöschl, 2015). This is tantamount to the soils, veg-
etation and topography belonging to a catchment co-evolving
together in response to the climate above and geology below
through both land-forming and life-sustaining processes operating
and interacting across multiple timescales (Fig. 6).
The focus can no longer be on just hydrological processes,
but all land surface processes that operate together and feed
back on each other, which thus takes hydrology into the
Figure 6. Co-evolution resulting from the interaction of a number of
processes (at least two: one represents hydrological processes and

realm of Earth system science. With this broader view, the
focus of analysis is therefore no longer on streamflow signatures
alone, but also on signatures arising from the co-
evolution of Earth system processes, such as vegetation and
erosional patterns that one sees in landscapes (Sivapalan,
2005; Brantley et al., 2017). Examples include patterns in
measured evapotranspiration at individual (e.g., FLUXNET)
sites (Thompson et al., 2011a), regional patterns of evapotranspiration
measured by remote sensing (Cheng et al.,
2011), and vegetation, soil and micro-topography patterns
in landscapes on a range of scales (Thompson et al., 2011b;
Saco et al., 2013; Harman et al., 2014). These are the kinds
of ecohydrologic and hydrogeomorphic phenomena that will
need to be further explored in the future and synthesized to
generate the new understanding and new theories required
to close the gap between bottom–up (reductionist) and top–
down (ecosystem) approaches to modeling.
These outcomes of co-evolution, framed as emergent phenomena,
may be different in different places, because of dif-
ferences in the history of co-evolution and initial and boundary
conditions of climate and geology. Comparative hydrol-
ogy, i.e., comparing many catchments in different places
along gradients of climate and geology, helps us to shed light
on their co-evolution, just as Charles Darwin interpreted differences
between animals, birds and plants he found in his
travels through the lens of their natural history (Harman and
Troch, 2014). The Darwinian approach to comparative hydrology
embraces the history of each place, including fea-
tures that are relics of historical events, as central to understanding
both its present and its future (Blöschl et al., 2013).
The essence of the Darwinian approach then is to develop
generalizations beyond individual catchments through learning
from differences between catchments, and interpreting
them as legacies of past co-evolution.

6.3 Hydrologic similarity and catchment classification:
steps towards generalization
Given the co-evolved nature of catchments, their structure
and function, and the resulting hydrologic responses, explanation
of the similarity and differences between catch-
ments must take a more Darwinian approach that emphasizes
timescale interactions specific to a place, and how the catchment
ecosystem may have adapted to these. While there can
be considerable diversity and randomness allowed in Darwinian
co-evolution of catchments due to contingency ef-
fects (Beven, 2015), patterns and connections may yet be
discernible which may lead to relationships of more general
applicability. One approach to creating order in an otherwise
heterogeneous world, widely adopted in chemistry and ecology,
is through the process of classification. As in the case of
the periodic table in chemistry, classification of catchments
based on hydrologic similarity may be used to group catchments,
helping to simplify relationships and generalize find-
ings. Hydrologic similarity is the foundation for the transfer
of information from one catchment to another, includ-
ing from gauged to ungauged catchments, and was the basis
for the successful outcomes of the Predictions in Ungauged
Basins (PUB) initiative (Sivapalan et al., 2003; Blöschl et al.,
2013; Hrachowitz et al., 2013). The PUB synthesis study by
Blöschl et al. (2013) framed hydrologic similarity in terms
of several signatures of runoff variability, such as the flow
duration curve and the flood frequency curve. The diversity
of catchment responses is such that no two catchments are
so similar that all signatures are the same between them, and
so for prediction purposes one concentrates only on the signature
of interest. However, as in the case of the compara-
tive hydrology study by Berghuijs et al. (2014), the synthesis
project by Blöschl et al. (2013) found that similarity of seasonal
water balance had a significant influence on the similar-
ity of other signatures too, and may be the strongest indicator
used to delineate hydrologically similar regions (Weingartner
and Aschwanden, 1992).
The organization of catchments into distinct classes based
on hydrologic similarity can open the way to understanding
the differences between the classes themselves in terms of the
underlying climatic, geologic and landscape controls. The
most celebrated example of progress in this area is the empirically
derived Budyko curve, famously named after Russian
hydrologist Mikhail Budyko. The Budyko curve graphically
expresses the long term (or mean annual) water balance, defined
by the ratio of long-term average evapotranspiration to
precipitation, E/P , as a universal function of climatic aridity,
the ratio of long-term average potential evaporation to
precipitation, Ep/P (Budyko, 1974). The existence of the
Budyko curve is usually explained as resulting from a competition
between water available (precipitation) and energy
available (potential evaporation). In the case of the MOPEX
catchments across the United States, Berghuijs et al. (2014)
found that the different catchment seasonal water balance
(and also vegetation/soil) classes clustered along different
segments of the Budyko curve, with little overlap. On the
basis of this and other evidence, one can then argue that the
competition between water and energy available is mediated
by the vegetation that forms through natural selection, highlighting
the key role of ecohydrology in hydrologic theory
development (Eagleson, 2002; Rodriguez-Iturbe, 2000).
The fact that most of the MOPEX catchments (and other
catchments of the world) fall on or about the Budyko curve
(leaving a large part of the Budyko space unoccupied) can
be seen as an empirical organizing principle, i.e., only some
combinations of climate, soil and vegetation characteristics
may exist in reality (i.e., are behavioral, Schaefli et al., 2011),
indicating a mutual co-dependence through Darwinian coevolution
and selection (Eagleson, 2002). Inspired by these
observations, in recent times several hydrologists have embarked
on a search for physical explanations for the exis-
tence of the Budyko curve (Wang and Tang, 2014; Wang et
al., 2015; Westhoff et al., 2016). Wang and Tang (2014) and
Wang et al. (2015) studied the conceptual bases for empirical
models developed by engineers (and geographers) from the
1930s to the 1950s to describe water balances across three
different timescales: event, seasonal and annual. These were
the SCS curve number method for runoff estimation at the
event scale (Mockus, 1949), the abcd model for seasonal
(monthly) water balance developed during the Harvard Water
Program in the 1960s (Thomas, 1981), and the L’vovich
method developed in the former Soviet Union for partitioning
of annual precipitation into fast and slow runoff and evaporation
(L’vovich, 1979). In the first phase of their work, Wang
and Tang (2014) and Wang et al. (2015) showed that all three
of them can be described in terms of the so-called proportionality
hypothesis, which is long understood as providing
the conceptual basis for the SCS curve number method. In
the second phase of their work, they showed that the proportionality
hypothesis, in turn, can be explained thermodynam-
ically, in terms of the principle of maximum entropy production
(MEP). One can thus see that the empirical proportion-
ality hypothesis and the thermodynamic MEP principle appear
to provide a vehicle to extend the hydrologic similarity
arising from co-evolution across multiple timescales. Admittedly,
these are only the first tentative steps in the quest for
new theories of hydrology, and yet more creative approaches
are needed to extend the notions of similarity and optimality
to cover not just the Budyko curve but all other signatures,
in order that we fully exploit the order or simplicity that may
arise out of Darwinian co-evolution.
The MEP principle, or the equivalent maximum power
principle proposed by Kleidon and Renner (2013) and used
by Westhoff et al. (2016) to derive the Budyko curve, can
be viewed as providing a constraint to the diversity exhibited
during Darwinian co-evolution and natural selection, possibly
as a mechanism to increase system resilience (Lotka et
al., 1922). Furthermore, existence of such physically based
organizing principles, valid on a range of timescales as indiwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/22/1665/2018/

 1680 M. Sivapalan: Milestones in the transformation of hydrologic science
cated in the work of Wang et al. (2015), can pave the way
for a new generation of behavioral models (Schaefli et al.,
2011). This is a promising development for two reasons.
On the one hand, it can help constrain model structures inferred
from rainfall–runoff data, and on the other hand, it can
constrain the parameter combinations allowed for otherwise
physically based models that are based on Newtonian mechanics
(Li et al., 2014). A unique advantage of the approach
adopted by Wang et al. (2015) is that it involved connecting
the dots between empirical methods that have been widely
used in engineering hydrology for over 50 years, and exploiting
the simplicity in these estimation methods that arise from
the very co-evolution we are trying to capture in our models
(e.g., flood frequency, Guo et al., 2014). Potentially, if continued
further, it will have the salutary effect of contributing to
fundamental advances while maintaining coherence through
avoiding fragmentation (Graham and Dayton, 2002; Blöschl
et al., 2013).
7 Timescale interactions in the Anthropocene: from
ecohydrology to socio-hydrology
The focus of the discussion in the last section was on
timescale interactions and the co-evolution of hydrologic
and other physical and biologic processes occurring in landscapes.
In the otherwise natural catchments considered so
far, the dynamic nature of catchment co-evolution was centered
on vegetation, its adaptation of itself and its environ-
ment through feedbacks between hydrologic and ecologic
processes across multiple timescales. This perspective was
introduced to assist with developing transferable understanding
between places in the course of data-based inference and
top–down modeling under otherwise stationary conditions.
As one begins to look to the future, one recognizes the
expanding human footprint, including land use and land
cover (e.g., vegetation) changes and human interferences
in the hydrologic cycle (e.g., water extraction from rivers
or groundwater aquifers) and the inevitable acceleration of
the timescale interactions. One can no longer count on stationarity
for making predictions of catchment responses un-
der these circumstances (Milly et al., 2008; Wagener et
al., 2010). Furthermore, over longer periods of time, the
timescale interactions must include two-way feedbacks between
hydrological (and other Earth system processes) and
human-social processes, and the emergent dynamics that result
from these. Thus, as we transition from our focus on eco-
hydrology so far (Eagleson, 2002; Rodriguez-Iturbe, 2000)
to the new field of socio-hydrology (Sivapalan et al., 2012),
we can recognize both similarities as well as differences between
the behaviors of vegetation and humans and, where
possible, benefit from lessons learned from the practice of
ecohydrology in the past 2 decades.
The co-evolution of water and vegetation does not stop
with vegetation adapting to the water and energy balances
and vice versa. We noticed that over time vegetation not only
adapts itself to the prevailing climate variability and water
balance dynamics (even as it modifies it at the same time), but
it does so through adapting (or engineering) the landscape
or environment around it as well, such as through modifying
the soils or topography. Work by Gao et al. (2014) drew
an analogy between humans and vegetation and highlighted
parallels in water consumption behavior between them. We
know humans build storages to cater to periods of drought
– in engineering hydrology we estimate the required storage
using (for example) the so-called Rippl method (Rippl,
1883). Analogously, Gao et al. (2014) proposed a root storage
design method for vegetation, similar to Rippl, where the
required storage capacity (with an analogy to root depth) was
the between-year maximum of the within-year (seasonal)
fluctuation (peak to trough) of soil moisture storage. They
extracted this information from the outcomes of the modeling
work they had done on a large number of MOPEX
catchments across the United States, from which they estimated
the pattern of root depth variation between the catch-
ments. They discovered strong correlations between the root
depth distributions obtained from such water balance analyses
and those independently obtained for the actual vege-
tation classes found in these catchments. This observation
lends strong support to the argument that vegetation adapts
itself optimally to the prevailing water balances (seasonal and
annual) through adapting itself and adapting its environment
so as to, in this case, make maximum use of the water available
(see also Troch et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2016; Brantley et
al., 2017). These studies confirm and build on the prescient
insight of Robert E. Horton, an early pioneer of hydrology
who wrote:
Natural vegetation of a region tends to develop to
such an extent that it can utilize the largest possible
proportion of the available soil moisture supplied
by infiltration. – Robert E. Horton (1933)
Note in passing the similarities between Robert Horton’s
foresight with modern explanatory theories in ecology such
as ecological niche theory (Chase, 2011) and niche construction
theory (Odling-Smee et al., 2003) that relate, respec-
tively, to how organisms modify themselves and modify their
environment.
Admittedly, the examples presented above very much represent
a top–down treatment of vegetation adaptation, which
I invoked only to make the connection to comparative hydrology,
and to highlight how model structures and parameteriza-
tions may vary between places through such adaptations. In
reality, these broad-scale patterns indicative of co-evolution
require further refinement in the context of predictive ecohydrologic
theories regarding vegetation adaptation to its en-
vironment. One example of this is the vegetation optimality
model (VOM) proposed by Schymanski et al. (2009) based
on the hypothesis that natural vegetation co-evolves with its
Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 1665–1693, 2018 www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/22/1665/2018/

environment and that over time natural selection leads to a
species composition most suited for the given environmental
conditions. In VOM this is represented by a trade-off be-
tween water loss and carbon gain formulated in terms of the
costs associated with the maintenance of roots, water transport
tissues and foliage, and the benefits related to the ex-
change of water for CO2 with the atmosphere, driven by photosynthesis.
In VOM the optimal vegetation is taken as the
one that maximizes “net carbon profit”, i.e., the difference
between carbon acquired by photosynthesis and carbon spent
on maintenance of organs involved in its uptake. Note however
that VOM is just one of many optimality theories that
have been proposed in ecohydrology, and is only presented
here as an illustrative example. There is increasing availability
of data on evaporative fluxes from a large number of flux
towers located in different biomes of the world (Thompson et
al., 2011a, b) and new remotely sensed datasets on both vegetation
cover and evapotranspiration rates over regional scales
(Cheng et al., 2011) to complement existing rainfall–runoff
data at catchment scales. There is enormous scope for these
new datasets to be used to test alternative theories of vegetation
adaptation (Brantley et al., 2017) and to provide guid-
ance for the choice of model structures in top–down models,
and thus help bridge the current impasse between top–down
and bottom–up models.
7.1 Human-engineered landscapes and catchment
water balances
We now know, at a minimum, how vegetation adapts itself
to the water balance and adapts the water balance through
its control. Increasingly, humans too interact with catchment
water balances, in some ways similar to how vegetation interacts
with the natural water balance. Humans extract wa-
ter directly from rivers or groundwater aquifers to meet their
needs, or might build dams across rivers to store water when
nature’s supply is low, such as during low flow or drought periods.
Just as vegetation engineers the landscape to gain and
maintain access to water, humans too engineer the landscape
(e.g., catchments) to gain and maintain access to water, and
to serve other human functions.
Previously hydrologists may only have been interested in
the short-term (and local) effects of land use changes and human
interferences in the hydrologic cycle to satisfy human
needs or functions. With the expansion of the human footprint,
they are increasingly concerned with longer-term hy-
drological changes brought about by human actions and how
the changed hydrology then feeds back to generate secondary
human reactions. Consequently, it is no longer sufficient, as
in the past, to model the hydrology of pristine catchments
and add human effects at the end (Wagener et al., 2010). For
long-term planning and strategic decision-making purposes,
humans must increasingly be treated as an intrinsic part of
the catchment’s water cycle. This also means that traditional
definitions of catchments as topographically defined must be
replaced or refined to account for administrative (or governance)
units. One can thus imagine how the explicit inclu-
sion of human behavior in hydrologic systems might over
long time periods give rise to a co-evolution of water and
people. For example, many ancient civilizations established
themselves around sources of water, and their success and
eventual collapse or dispersal were emergent outcomes of
co-evolutionary feedbacks between humans and water (e.g.,
the Tarim basin in western China, Liu et al., 2014). Under
these changing circumstances, one thus moves from ecohydrology,
the study of two-way feedbacks between vegetation
response and catchment water balance, to socio-hydrology,
the new science dealing with two-way feedbacks between
human behavior (e.g., water management) and catchment responses
(e.g., water balance, flooding dynamics) (Sivapalan
et al., 2012, 2014). This extends our earlier Earth system science
perspective now to include human-social processes as
well.
How far can we push the analogy between vegetation and
humans? Unlike vegetation, humans need water not just for
their physiological needs (i.e., for drinking), but also for
sanitation, and even more so for use in industries, and for
food and energy production. This introduces an economic
purpose to the use of water, and excessive water extraction
for economic uses impacts the environment in adverse
ways, and impacts the ability of the environment to produce
the ecosystem services (including the delivery of water) that
humans also depend on. This introduces the notion of the
water–food–energy–environment nexus, and the requirement
to make tradeoffs between these various human needs. Two
additional factors that enter the management of the water–
food–energy–environment nexus are advances in technology
(e.g., infrastructure that enables extraction and transfers of
real water between places) and trade (e.g., trade of food and
other commodities that depend on water for their production,
also known as virtual water trade). Another compounding
factor is the role of institutional system of administration,
legislation and regulation of water (Sivapalan and Blöschl,
2015). Under these circumstances, human involvement in hydrologic
systems in the past has been studied extensively in
the context of water resource management, where the focus
has been on optimal management (Loucks et al., 2005).
Much of this work has worked on the belief that humans
are optimizers, assumed to make rational decisions about allocation
of resources between various needs, and opting to
maximize economic livelihood. However, with the advent
of socio-hydrology, hydrologic science has broadened to include
the practices and outcomes of water resource manage-
ment, in the presence of the aforementioned complexities, as
themselves subjects for explanation and deeper understanding
(Thompson et al., 2013).
A major complexity in understanding and eventually predicting
human behavior in the context of water management
is human agency (Sanderson et al., 2017). Unlike natural
systems, e.g., vegetation, humans can choose among difwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/22/1665/2018/

ferent modes of thinking and courses of action that impact
the natural systems within which they are embedded. A major
challenge is that human decision-making shapes, and is
shaped by, the cultural contexts within which human societies
are embedded. Humans draw upon commonly held val-
ues, beliefs and norms to guide their actions, and in turn
can collectively change their cultures in the long term (Caldas
et al., 2015). Human–water interactions are heavily in-
fluenced by differences and/or dynamic changes in human
values and norms in respect of their economic livelihood
and the environment. Unlike natural systems whose longterm
co-evolutionary behavior can be expressed in terms
of organizing principles (e.g., vegetation optimality, maximum
entropy production), humans can appear to make de-
cisions away from any optimality principles and to violate
their own laws (Fig. 7, Sivapalan and Blöschl, 2015). For
example, they may extract water from a well, even if it is
illegal to do so; or they may choose to live with pollution,
away from optimality reasons, giving the impression
that unlike vegetation, humans are irrational. The net effects
of such human decisions on water systems may manifest
as puzzles, paradoxes, and other unintended consequences,
nevertheless exhibiting similarities and differences that reflect
distinct hydro-climatic, eco-environmental, and socio-
economic features (Sivapalan, 2015; Pande and Sivapalan,
2017). These factors make human–water interactions much
more complex and thus add to the already difficult prediction
challenges in hydrology (Westerberg et al., 2017). Note,
however, that differences highlighted above between natural
and human-impacted systems can at least partly be at-
tributed to the timescales of processes relative to the length
of available data records. It is tempting to think that, given
long enough records, co-evolutionary behavior in respect of
coupled human–water system dynamics may indeed be governed
by some (as yet unknown) organizing principles. In
the end, then, it is a pragmatic choice whether one sees or
assumes well-organized patterns within the available data
records (Sivapalan and Blöschl, 2005).
It has been suggested that changes in culture and associated
values and preferences may be more predictive of hu-
man behavior in the context of sustainability than rationality,
or utility maximization (Caldas et al., 2015). Examples of
human behavior different from utility maximization include
(Sivapalan et al., 2014): the peaking in water resource availability
as basins develop (peak water paradox, Kandasamy
et al., 2014); increasing levee heights in urban environments
at the expense of increased flood risk (levee effect, Di Baldassarre
et al., 2013); increasing agriculture water consump-
tion in spite of irrigation efficiency improvements (irrigation
efficiency paradox) (Scott, 2011); and over-exploitation
of coastal aquifers at the risk of causing saltwater intrusion
(Chang and Clement, 2012). An example of non-optimal behavior
in the context of coupled human–water system dy-
namics is lock-in or path dependence, which is one explanation
offered for the collapse of the Maya civilization (Kuil

laws; (b) Human systems may violate constraints and make irrational
decisions away from optimality (taken from Sivapalan and
Blöschl, 2015).
et al., 2016). A more recent example of lock-in is the selfreinforcing
action of the people of the Netherlands since the
11th century to drain their naturally peaty soils, leading to
land subsidence, which ultimately led to the invention of
the famous Gouda cheese, since the resulting low-lying areas
that these actions produced were only suitable for dairy
farming (Erkens et al., 2016). The science of socio-hydrology
aims to explain these kinds of phenomena arising from twoway
feedbacks associated with coupled human–water sys-
tem dynamics, and to develop a generalized understanding
that can connect diverse phenomena across many places and
times (Sivapalan and Blöschl, 2015). There is still room for
predictions in this new era of socio-hydrology: but given the
difficulties of dealing with human agency and complex human
behavior, the focus is not on predicting what will happen
at a future prescribed time, as it is in traditional hydrology,
but on mapping out the possibility space of future trajectories
of system co-evolution (see Fig. 8, Srinivasan et al., 2017).
8 Engineering hydrology to Earth system science: from
Newton to Darwin to Wegener
There is no question that there has been a fundamental transformation
of hydrology in the past 50 years. My goal in
this narrative has been to connect the dots and draw up a
continuous thread through what I thought were major milestones
in the evolution of the science. Hydrology (for me)
started as engineering hydrology, addressing rather simple,
well-defined problems (e.g., what is the 100-year flood?).
Over time, problems became increasingly complex, such as
the need to predict the effects of land use changes or climate
change (e.g., on 100-year floods), which required more
process-based approaches invoking Newtonian mechanics.
Even as the ability to make predictions using such physiHydrol.

cally based models advanced, they encountered limitations
due to unknown (and unknowable) heterogeneity of landscapes,
and the lack of understanding of process interactions
in the time domain, including how catchments functioned as
whole ecosystems. Conceptual or functional models based
on data-based inference partially helped to overcome these
limitations, but they in turn suffered from heavy dependence
on data, and the absence of holistic theories of catchment responses
and ecosystem functioning.
The seeming impasse between the two approaches to predictions,
mechanistic and functional, has motivated hydrolo-
gists to broaden the research from the traditional focus on
estimation and prediction towards understanding, explanation
and discovery. The shift towards understanding and ex-
planation does not signify a lack of commitment to applications
of hydrology, however. The goal of hydrology as
use-inspired basic science (Stokes, 1997; Thompson et al.,
2013) remains, which is to generate the basic understanding
necessary to address the complex water sustainability
or management problems that appear on the horizon. The
nature and role of predictions have also evolved as problems
become more complex and highly inter-disciplinary.
The change in focus towards understanding and explanation
is contributing to two major shifts in hydrology research. The
first is increased attention to phenomena, emergent patterns
that arise through process interactions across timescales and
space scales. Numerical models are increasingly now used to
test hypotheses about how these phenomena may have arisen
and thus contribute towards accumulation of knowledge and
understanding. The second major shift is towards comparative
hydrology, i.e., comparative studies across gradients of
climate, geology and human impacts. This is a Darwinian
approach, which seeks to develop new insights and theories
about catchments, as consisting of components that have coevolved
together, and to learn from the common history of
their co-evolution.
Given this co-evolutionary perspective, hydrological problems
needed to be framed broadly as inter-disciplinary prob-
lems that extend beyond the study of water flows in landscapes.
In natural landscapes we are increasingly concerned
with water flow processes interacting with and feeding back
on land-forming (e.g., pedogenesis, soil erosion and deposition)
and life-sustaining (e.g., biogeochemical, ecological)
processes. With the expanding human footprint, hydrology
also has to deal with vastly complex social processes. An
example (one of many) of a new problem that hydrologists
have to deal with in this context is the nature of interactions
between people and droughts that might lead to exacerbation
of water shortages (Apurv et al., 2017), conflicts, human
migration, and even collapse (Kuil et al., 2016). This places
hydrology squarely within the realm of Earth system science,
with an alternate set of problems, questions, and study tools.
With the broadening of the science there is increasing attention
to a diversity of emergent phenomena that arise in the
context of co-evolution of climate, soils, vegetation, and now
humans.
Exploring phenomena of all kinds – defined as interesting
catchment responses or ecosystem functioning with no
obvious or immediate explanation – and asking how they
came about, which is the scientific method practiced and perfected
over centuries, is increasingly the main focus of most
hydrological investigations. Bronowski (1956) describes the
majesty of the scientific method in these terms:
All science is the search for unity in hidden likenesses.
. . The progress of science is the discovery
at each step of a new order which gives unity to
what had long seemed unlike. . . For order does not
display itself of itself; if it can be said to be there
at all, it is not there for the mere looking. . . order
must be discovered and, in a deep sense, it must be
created. What we see, as we see it, is mere disorder.
– Bronowski (1956)
Increasingly, in a co-evolutionary context, one can adopt
three different kinds of approaches to generate and study
phenomena of interest to us. These may be framed as historical
hydrology, comparative hydrology and process hy-
drology. Historical hydrology generates phenomena in the
form of emergent dynamics in the time domain arising
from timescale interactions. Comparative hydrology generates
patterns of catchment responses between different catch-
ments or places. Process hydrology generates patterns at a
single place, resulting from process interactions in space (or
space–time).
The evolution of the science and the growth of hydrological
understanding over the past 50 years have benefited from
the use of a combination of Newtonian and Darwinian approaches
to address and explore increasingly complex pre-
diction problems and emergent phenomena. The Newtonian

studies) and Darwinian (learning from a population of catchments

approach benefits from the fact that it is based on universal
laws of mass, momentum and energy balances, with clear
causality. It gains predictive power through advances in observing
and understanding processes, and approaches to ac-
count for landscape heterogeneity and the resulting complexity
of flow pathways and residence times. Yet it loses
effectiveness in making general predictions by not being
able to fully account for process interactions and feedbacks
and parameter co-dependency that manifest in catchments
through co-evolutionary processes. The legacy of past coevolutionary
processes in landscapes and their interconnec-
tions over long time periods lead to complex emergent spatial
patterns and temporal dynamics. So an alternative approach
to studying patterns and dynamics arising from such coevolution
is to study many catchments comparatively, treat-
ing them as legacies of past co-evolution, which is the Darwinian
way. In short, the Newtonian approach generalizes
by discovering universal laws governing particular processes
through experimentation, inductive reasoning and through
mathematical derivations, whereas the Darwinian approach
generalizes by recognizing emergent phenomena through
comparative analyses across places and then seeking explanations
for how they came about (Guo et al., 2014). Of
course, Newtonian and Darwinian methods are complementary
to each other, and progress in terms of new theories of
hydrology and improvements in our ability make future predictions
everywhere will require a synthesis of these two ap-
proaches (Fig. 9) (Harte, 2002; Blöschl et al., 2013).
8.1 Crystal balling the future: from comparative
hydrology to regional process hydrology
One of the benefits of developing a historical narrative, as I
have done here, is that it provides a perspective view (rightly
or wrongly) of where we have come from and where we
may be (or should be) headed. I will therefore be remiss
if I do not use the “crystal ball” that I have created in my
mind based on this review to say something about what is in
store for hydrology in the coming decade(s). In doing so I
stand to benefit from a perspective that has helped me most
to organize my narrative: this is the scale perspective. The
issue of scale has been at the heart of most of the difficulties
hydrologists have had in terms of developing new the-
ories and advancing predictions. If at all we have made any
progress in hydrology, this may be attributed to advances we
have made in addressing scale issues (Blöschl and Sivapalan,
1995; Blöschl et al., 2013). So now, going over the progress
we have made in hydrology over the last 50 years (Sivapalan
and Blöschl, 2017), one cannot but recognize the change in
focus from time during the empirical era (engineering hydrology),
to space (Newtonian mechanics) during the process
era, and back to time (Darwinian comparative hydrology) in
the current co-evolutionary era. By induction, this symmetry
tells me that even while remaining within the co-evolutionary
framework, the next major change in focus is likely to be (or
even should be) to go back to space, and to space–time.
It occurs to me that for far too long we hydrologists (or far
too many of us) have focused on catchments as isolated objects,
with an exclusive focus on their rainfall–runoff (input–
output) transformations. Even in the context of comparative
hydrology, we have continued to treat them as spatially distinct
and independent objects, even while acknowledging or
exploiting their common or similar co-evolutionary history.
Clearly this is limiting, in terms of the phenomena that we
can explore, and the kinds of predictions we increasingly
have to make at larger spatial scales. If we extend the size
of the study domain from isolated catchments to a whole
region, then in many cases the catchments present within
the region have spatial connectivity, as well as a common
history. Catchments within a region can be connected to
each other in three ways: downwind movement of water in
the atmosphere, downstream water movement through surface
pathways (e.g., rivers), and subsurface water movement
(e.g., regional aquifers) from recharge areas in the mountains
towards the ocean, leading to groundwater outcropping in
streams, lakes and wetlands, and to estuaries and deltas in
coastal regions. In this way there is a continual transformation
across the region in the nature of interactions between
atmospheric, surface and subsurface pathways of water, producing
unique waterscapes. This inexorably takes us into a
new field that we might as well call regional process hydrology.
Just as a single catchment is viewed as a co-evolved
ecosystem, owing to the co-evolution of different components
(i.e., mountain range, headwater catchments, river net-
work and floodplains, wetlands and estuaries), the region too
needs to be looked at and managed as a whole ecosystem. An
example of such a region satisfying these features is the arid
Kaidu–Kongqi River basin in western China, which is supplied
by snowmelt and glacier melt in its headwaters, feed-
ing an extensive oasis and the terminal Bosten Lake, both of
which support a thriving agricultural community in the midst
of a vast desert (Fig. 10).
The Kaidu–Konqi River basin, and many others like it
around the world (e.g., the Indus River basin in presentHydrol.

day Pakistan, the Cauvery River basin in southern India),
have been cradles of human civilization that have waxed and
waned as a result of long-term, large-scale climatic changes,
as well as human alterations of their waterscapes and overexploitation
of land and water resources (Liu et al., 2014).
The complexity of water balances and long-term water management
problems across such regions cannot be tackled by
studying a few isolated catchments. As we begin to look at
a region as a whole, the proposed regional outlook opens up
new possibilities to advance hydrology, with altogether new
emergent phenomena that arise through interactions of the
atmosphere, land surface and regional groundwater aquifers,
including the waterscapes that form as a result. This regional
hydrology focus can also bring about the overdue unification
of surface (catchment) hydrology with groundwater hydrology,
and extensions of ecohydrology and socio-hydrology, to
explore interesting, regional-scale phenomena.
I am not the first one to make the case for regional process
hydrology, however. Tom Dunne, in his famous Abel
Wolman Lecture (Dunne, 1998), called for a renewed focus
on research targets at large spatial scales (i.e., regional) that
are “of broad significance and might attract sustained interest
from scientists in other fields and society at large”. There is
already much activity in regional process hydrology that is
beginning to bring surface and/or groundwater hydrologists
together with atmospheric scientists, with a focus on modeling,
large-scale synergistic observations and data–model
syntheses (Fan, 2015; Hipsey et al., 2015; Maxwell et al.,
2015; Blöschl et al., 2017). Echoing Dunne (1998) himself,
my main argument is to go beyond mere descriptions or narratives
as we may have done in the past, and to reinforce
the focus on phenomena, now regional-scale phenomena, and
on process explanation and discovery, as a prelude to eventual
predictions at these scales. The relevant processes of in-
terest occur at all space scales and timescales, and are not
limited to just small scales, and emergent phenomena arise
out of these multi-scale (space, space–time) process interactions.
Both Newtonian (bottom–up reductionist) and Dar-
winian (top–down functional) approaches and their synthesis
retain currency, including the use of coarse-grained models
to explore observed phenomena. So this is regional process
hydrology that requires a whole system synergistic perspective.
Within the spirit of use-inspired basic science (Stokes,
1997; Thompson et al., 2013) the move towards regional hydrology
also coincides with the evolution of the nature of
water management problems that will be faced in the emergent
Anthropocene. Thompson et al. (2013) presented sev-
eral examples of anticipated century-scale trends in the main
hydrologic drivers that will impact humanity in the future.
These emerging future challenges include changing demography
(Wagener et al., 2010), warming climate (Vörösmarty
et al., 2000), rapid urbanization (Di Baldassarre et al., 2010),
changing rainfall variability (Blöschl et al., 2017), loss of
freshwater resources due to rising sea levels and saltwater
intrusion (Chang et al., 2011), and globalization of water systems
through real and virtual water trade (Konar et al., 2016).
One can anticipate a range of water-related problems and secondary
effects that will emerge in response to these drivers.
Increasingly these problems will manifest at regional (and
global) scales and can no longer be addressed through the
study of individual, isolated catchments. Instead, we need a
regional, increasingly global, approach to the study of these
problems. Each of these problems is likely to draw attention

to an array of emergent phenomena that manifest at the regional
scale, and associated science questions, which could
be the basis for the next major exciting phase of research in
scientific hydrology.
The extension of the co-evolutionary perspective in space
towards the regional scale takes us further from even Darwinian
comparative hydrology (of isolated catchments) to the
kind of approach adopted by Alfred Wegener, which eventually
led to the discovery of plate tectonics. During his ex-
tensive journeys around the world, Wegener evaluated multiple
variables (e.g., fossil records, rock types) across sev-
eral continental regions with which he drew coherent spatial
connections across places to support his reasoning on
the continental drift (Fig. 11). Such an approach becomes
feasible in hydrology too with the extraction of spatial patterns
of multiple variables (e.g., climate, hydrology, vegeta-
tion, animals, people) across large regions, which could then
serve as the basis for breakthroughs in understanding of regional
water balance, and the co-evolutionary dynamics of
climate, soils, vegetation, and human settlements that contribute
to the formation of regional waterscapes. Much can
be learned from studying spatial teleconnections (especially
upstream–downstream) through remote sensing techniques
and regional models (Guan et al., 2014), and how they impact
and in turn are impacted by human alterations to landscapes
and watercourses. Even though much of this is necessarily
place-based, unique to particular regions, there is also much
that can be transferred to other regions.
As the world becomes inter-connected through improvements
in communications technology, trade, and the move-
ment of people and ideas, along with global teleconnections
in the climate system, it is increasingly necessary to go even
further and treat the world as a single inter-connected system
(Eagleson, 1986; Lall, 2014). Within the one-world sys-
tem, anticipated global changes are likely to give rise to yet
more complex phenomena manifesting as new and challenging
water-related problems at both regional and global scales.
This will require truly global and long-term vision and passion,
the type of passion that led Alfred Wegener to discover
continental drift and to open up the debate that ultimately led
to the development of the theory of plate tectonics. Achieving
this grand vision in hydrology will probably take us into what
we have called the globalization era (Sivapalan and Blöschl,
2017), with a grand synthesis of global hydrology integrated
with economics and climate science, as also concluded in an
earlier review by Bierkens (2015). These are exciting times
to be a hydrologist.
8.2 Lessons from Newton, Darwin, and Wegener:
connecting the dots
This paper being an outgrowth of my Wegener Medal Lecture,
in conclusion, I feel duty bound to reflect on the lessons
we as hydrologists can learn from the methods adopted by
not only Wegener, but also Newton and Darwin, and their
contributions to science and the scientific pursuit. The ultimate
goal in science is to “connect the dots”, i.e., “to find
order in disorder” (Bronowski, 1956), which should be the
ultimate goal in hydrologic science too. It is in this spirit that
Dooge (1986) exhorted us “to look for hydrological laws”
and Klemeš (1986) warned against the “dilettantism” that results
from failure to distinguish between science and applica-

tions of the science, as between hydrograph fitting and hydrological
understanding. In his paper on “a hydrologic perspec-
tive”, Klemeš (1988) emphasized the primacy of process understanding
over techniques, i.e., the unravelling of the puz-
zles of the water cycle over the kinds of technologies that are
adopted to solve societal problems, and warned against defining
catchments merely by the different techniques that we
might use from time to time to analyze them as engineering
hydrologists. Regardless of the different methods they may
have used, Newton, Darwin and Wegener, were ultimately
giants in the art of connecting the dots, and we stand to benefit
from the legacy they have left behind. Methods may come
and go, but success depends on us not becoming slaves to
the methods but treating them as necessary tools for a higher
purpose, i.e., advancing science through connecting the dots.

the EGU for bestowing this honor on me and for giving me
the opportunity to publish this paper in HESS. My thoughts
on the evolution of hydrology came about through interactions
with many students and colleagues over the years. They
gained potency through my involvement in three community
activities: the Predictions in Ungauged Basins (PUB) initiative,
the University of Illinois Hydrologic Synthesis activity,
and the Predictions under Change activity, which morphed
into the Socio-hydrology movement, and both contributed to
the launch of the IAHS Panta Rhei initiative. I am proud of
the global hydrology community I served and learned from.

In closing, I bring up a line from Kondraiventhan, an
anthology of poems written by legendary Tamil poetess
Avvaiyar, who lived in southern India c. 1000 years ago. It
reads:

(i.e., our windows to the world)
These immortal words of Avvaiyar help me to celebrate
the memory of two teachers I had at Hartley College, Point
Pedro, Sri Lanka, the high school from which I entered
university. S. Ratnasabapathy taught me Mathematics and
S. S. Manuelpillai taught English. They both also shaped
my intellectual outlook and the way to approach personal
and professional challenges. It is not an exaggeration to say
that the discipline, persistence and pursuit of excellence they
instilled in me continue to guide me more than 50 years after
they had taught me.
