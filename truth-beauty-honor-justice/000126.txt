COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- — 312 — ------------------------------------------- The Gift as Hypertext: Digital Databases ------------------------------------------- Anyone who is going to read a somewhat sadistic author like Nabokov must keep encyclopedias, dictionaries, and handbooks handy if he wants to understand even half of what is going on . . . The reader must be a researcher. Carl Proffer, Keys to Lolita The Gift as Hypertext: Digital Databases Though arguably the greatest Russian novel of the past century, The Gift is also Nabokov’s most challenging work, especially for readers lacking familiarity with Russian and European culture and history of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In this book I have decided not to provide a page by page commentary to The Gift for several reasons: fi rstly, because it would expand the present edition considerably, and secondly because this effort has already been made by Alexander Dolinin in his exemplary commentary to the Russian edition of the novel, published in the fourth volume of Nabokov’s Collected Works by Symposium (1999–2001). Since this publication a decade ago, Dolinin has been regularly updating his fi ndings, and the expanded English translation of his work is due to appear soon. Some additional important work aimed at providing essential explanatory commentary on the novel has been undertaken by the students in courses on Nabokov taught by the author of this book over the few past years at Dalhousie University in Canada. The project was established as a wiki and has allowed students to collaborate and to display their work both to their peers and to any interested readers worldwide through the creation of an original scholarly compendium with multimedia material and digital images. The main goal was to create a comprehensive concordance, along with some basic annotations, but without exploring the subtle literary allusions in the way that Alexander Dolinin has done so well. This collaborative project has yielded a functioning computerized database devoted to the novel, where commentary is organized both page by page and alphabetically (hyperlinks lead to an extensive network of materials, and various articles are interconnected and provide a useful critical apparatus to Nabokov’s novel). Paintings, photographs, and other works of visual art are linked on this site for identifi cation and critical commentary, including images illustrative of a particular technique or school.

Some general imperatives related to broader problems of commentary, as well as those peculiar to The Gift, should be touched upon. I will outline some rules of thumb which can be applied to studying and appreciating Nabokov’s last novel of the Russian period, and provide some specifi c examples. A typical complaint about annotating literature in general and Nabokov in particular that has been raised again in the debates surrounding the recent publication of Nabokov’s last unfi nished English novel, The Original of Laura (Knopf, 2009), is that academic studies by nature concentrate their attention on detailed aspects of Nabokov’s oeuvre and tend to establish that Nabokov knew an outlandish amount about almost everything . . . [T]hey establish clearly that Nabokov knew a surprising amount about, respectively, painting, especially Old Master painting, and science — and they establish that knowledge with sanity and energy, and no hint of the presence of Charles Kinbote, the crazy enthusiast who takes over the task of annotating John Shade’s work in Pale Fire, and who presides over Nabokov studies like Banquo’s ghost (Lanchester 16). — 314 — --------------------------------------------------- What Constitutes a Footnote? --------------------------------------------------- Indeed, one would not want to resemble Kinbote in his academic writing, and comments by critics and general readership such as the one above should not be simply dismissed, despite what might be interpreted as disdain towards serious scholarship. In a more sober context, an example of a very close, almost a “Kinbotian,” reading of the opening pages of The Gift will be offered in the second part of this chapter. A commentator’s goals, to a certain extent, can be modeled on the literary- philosophical school of explication in Judaism. Wolfgang Iser maintains that “interpretation as we have come to understand it in the West arose out of the exegesis of the Torah in the Judaic tradition” (Iser 13). The oral tradition of the Torah distinguishes between four basic approaches in analyzing the Biblical text: Pshat (this level refers to the intended meaning of the text), Remez (alluded meaning, hint), Drash (interpretative or allegorical meaning that is not explicit in the text), and Sod (literary, secret; the mystical or esoteric meaning). The entire complex of the four levels is referred to as Pardes, an acronym formed from the fi rst letters of each word, which also means ‘orchard’ in Hebrew (the English word “paradise” is derived from the same root). In the case of The Gift we are mainly concerned with Pshat, or the intended meaning of Nabokov’s work. In my close reading, which I call a “total commentary,” I will offer a near-molecular analysis, registering direct linguistic links between the words along with the thematic nodes and subtexts in the narrative itself. What Constitutes a Footnote? Names and Characters I will start with what would seem to be the easiest method — by posing a series of empirical questions and possible answers. What must be annotated in order to provide essential assistance to the reader when dealing with such a complicated work of art as The Gift? Obviously, the historical events, dates and real-life personae mentioned in the narrative should be glossed in notes. Thus we would have, for instance, for all the names occurring on just one page (G50): Italian composer Giacomo Puccini (1858–1924); French author Anatole France (1844–1924); Italian actress Eleonora Duse (1858–1924), known for her naturalistic and unique style as well as for her many love affairs, and British mountaineer George Mallory (1886–1924), who took part in the British expeditions to Mount Everest in the early 1920s. The Gift enlists real people from fi elds as diverse as science, the arts, and politics both contemporary and historical: from the “Westernizing” Russian Tsar Peter the Great (1672– 1725), to the German revolutionary philosopher Karl Marx (1818–83); from — 315 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- the canonical John Milton (1608–74) and Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1829) to the less recognized (in our time) German general and statesman Paul von Hindenberg (1847–1934) and French mathematician and politician Paul Painlevé (1863–1933). How extensive should the encyclopedic information on each mentioned character be? Minimal biographic data would suffi ce; it is essential to indicate the era and occupation of a given historical fi gure. Briefl y noting the relevance of each character to the narrative, whenever this makes practical sense, would add to the understanding of the larger context and the theme in question. Sample: Sand, George: “George Sand” was the pseudonym of the French novelist and feminist Amantine-Lucile-Aurore Dupin, later Baroness Dudevant (1804–76). Frau Stoboy is said to have “George-Sandesque regality” (G9). The possibility that “his restive spouse should take to it into her head to wear male dress — in the manner of George Sand” is one of Chernyshevski’s points against marriage as he weighs the pros and cons in his “Diary of my Relations with Her Who now Constitutes my Happiness” (G9, 229). The commentator will have to make choices based on assumptions about the a priori knowledge of the contemporary audience, presuming, for example, that some readers might be more familiar with the German philosophers Immanuel Kant and Georg Hegel than with the ancient Greek classics: page 67 features three of them — Pythagoras, Anaximenes, and Phales (also known as Thales the Milesian, c. 624 bc — c. 546 bc); if this is the case, then the fundamental theoretical doctrines can be sketched in a couple sentences for each. The same principle applies to politicians (Édouard Herriot [1872–1957], three times President of France’s Third Republic, is virtually unknown today outside of his native country; G36) and eminent writers: the commentator should probably omit introductory information whenever Leo Tolstoy is mentioned in the text, but he will have to insert some explanations regarding less famous yet important Russian novelists appearing on the pages of The Gift — Nikolai Leskov (1831–95), Aleksey Pisemsky (1821–81), and Sergei Aksakov (1791–1859; remembered for his semi-autobiographical tales of a landlord’s family life, hunting, and butterfl y collecting). When Ivan Turgenev’s (1818–83) name surfaces, the relevance of his programmatic novel Fathers and Sons (1861) to Fyodor’s life and the text’s central paradigm should be mentioned; in the same vein, Nabokov’s far from reverent attitude to Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821–81) may be noted in connection with this writer. Nabokov’s personal predilections color his prose, both in negative and positive contexts. This is true with respect to Mikhail Lermontov (1814–41), a romantic writer and poet, who died in a duel like Pushkin, and whose works — 316 — --------------------------------------------------- What Constitutes a Footnote? --------------------------------------------------- Nabokov admired and translated into English. In The Gift, the critic Christopher Mortus quotes Lermontov’s poem “The Angel” in his critique of Fyodor’s novel (the line from the poem reads: “And the sounds of heaven could not be replaced / With the dull songs of the earth”; G73, 203, 304). The effect of “turning realia into realiora intensifi es when the author injects into this world a dose of accurate references to authentic sources which can be checked by the reader” (Barabtarlo 17). One of Nabokov’s challenges in writing The Gift was evidently the construction of Fyodor’s father’s persona. To bring this complex fi gure to life, Nabokov places him right next to some recognizable fi gures from the historical milieu: “I liked the fact that, in contra distinction to the majority of non-Russian travelers, Sven Hedin for example, [father] never changed his clothes for Chinese ones on his wanderings” (G113). Indeed, Sven Hedin explains that he never “renounced the prestige European garments confer” (Hedin, Enfardgenom 1:303). “However, in order to be allowed into Lhasa, Hedin disguised himself as a Lamaist pilgrim from Mongolia (Hedin, Scoutliv 293-5), wearing Mongol clothes, shaving his head, and dirtying his skin; on his later travels he liked to pose in various local costumes. The ploy was not successful; rain and sweat used to wash away the mud, and the Tibetan spies were never fooled as to the identity of this ‘pilgrim’” (Zimmer 40). Like all compound descriptions in the novel, the continuation of the very same passage quoted above borrows from another source, this time Russian (Przheval’skii 8; noted by Dolinin, quoted in Zimmer): “In camp [father] practiced shooting, which served as an excellent precaution against any importuning” (G113). Nabokov not only connects the historical Hedin and the fi ctitious Godunov-Cherdyntsev, but also invents a dialogue between them: Sven Hedin, sitting next to my father, asked him how it had happened that, traveling with unprecedented freedom over the forbidden parts of Tibet, in the immediate vicinity of Lhasa, he had not gone to look at it, to which my father replied that he had not wanted to sacrifice even one hour's collecting for the sake of visiting “one more filthy little town” . . . (G113) Dieter Zimmer is right to point out that the last Europeans to be allowed into Lhasa in the nineteenth century were the French missionaries Gabet and Huc in 1846: “All others who tried were turned back about 200 km away. The two who probably tried hardest were Przhevalsky (1879) and Sven Hedin (1901). Hedin [in his 1913 report] gives a detailed account of how he was complimented out of the country by Tibetan troops and offi cials” (Zimmer 41). Yet one more intertextual touch in Godunov-Cherdyntsev’s uncomplimentary description of Lhasa (“one more fi lthy little town”; G113) has a documentary source that requires explication. Évariste-Régis Huc writes in Souvenirs d’un voyage dans — 317 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- la Tartarie et le Thibet pendant les années 1844, 1845 et 1846 (Paris: Adrien le Clerc, 1850; Russian trans.: E. R. Huc. Vospominaniia o puteshestvii po Tatarii. St. Petersburg: Vol’f, 1866): “Lha-Sa is not a large town, its circuit being at the utmost two leagues [c. 10 km] . . . The principal streets of Lha-sa are broad, well laid out, and tolerably clean, at least when it does not rain: but the suburbs are revoltingly fi lthy” (Huc 2:170). Alexander Dolinin suggests that the remark may also have been prompted by the Russian Buriat G. Ts. Tsybikov, who visited Lhasa as a Buddhist pilgrim in 1899–1902 and in his book Buddist-palomnik u sviatyn’ Tibeta (A Buddhist Pilgrim among the Shrines of Tibet; Petrograd, 1919: 94, 101) described Lhasa as an extremely fi lthy place where people relieved themselves in the streets (both quoted in Zimmer 41). Playing with Readers Cases of references to real people mixed with purely fi ctional characters are tricky by default; as Gene Barabtarlo points out in his discussion of the dramatis personae in Pnin, “a slight adjustment or merely a shift of familiar accent in presenting well-known persons produces a subtle but distinct ‘not-quite-of-this- world’ sensation” (Barabtarlo 17). There are quite a few such semi-fi ctitious characters in The Gift. The civil engineer named Kern, whom Fyodor Godunov- Cherdyntsev encounters at the Chernyshevskis’ Berlin apartment, is a typical example: as noted earlier in the chapter entitled “Structure,” the engineer’s name bears easily recognizable Pushkinian associations (via Anna Kern), but he also shares his name with a prominent German linguist, Otto Kern (1863–1942). Nabokov’s selection of a name with potential associations usually creates an array of resonating meanings — none of which, however, seems to be dominant; the reference instead ends up serving as a red herring. The commentator’s task is to point out Nabokov’s such deliberate attempts to confuse, or “red herrings.” An illustration of Nabokov’s onomastic deceit is the character named X. B. Lambovski (G107). The narrator’s remark, that “there was something paschal about him,” requires explanation: the “Pas chal” overtones hint at a quasi-religious connection. “X. B. Lambovski” is a literal translation from the Russian original (which the Anglophone reader could not possibly understand). The man’s surname in Russian is Baranovski, which derives from baran, meaning “ram,” whence the related, Paschal “lamb” in English (with the difference that “baran” also implies “dolt” in Russian). But hidden in this “translation” is the fact that the man’s initials, if read as Cyrillic letters, are the traditional abbreviation for the Russian Orthodox Easter greeting in Old Church Slavonic: “Christ is risen” (“Khristos voskrese,” for which the Cyrillic abbreviation reads “Х. В.”) — commonly used on Russian postcards in Nabokov’s youth (Alexandrov 136). Although the — 318 — ----------------------------------------------------------- Playing with Readers ----------------------------------------------------------- true prototype behind the ridiculed Lambovski-Baranovski remains unknown so far, to some of Nabokov’s contemporaries his satirical approach seemed too cruel; the author of The Gift answered these charges in a letter to Mark Aldanov: I was guided not by an urge to laugh at this or that person (although there would be no crime in that — we are not in class or in church), but solely by a desire to show a certain order of literary ideas, typical at a given time — which is what the whole novel is about (its main heroine is litera ture). If in this case a style of criticism I feature corresponds to the style of particular figures and fops, that is natural and unavoidable. (Quoted in Boyd 480) Nabokov ends his letter with a frank statement that seems prophetic today: “You say that The Gift can count on a very long life. If that’s the case, then it’s all the more obliging to take along for the ride, free of charge, some of my contemporaries who would otherwise have stayed at home forever” (Ibid.). Who else had the opportunity to ride at Nabokov’s expense? Mostly those whom Nabokov needed in order to propel his plot — multiple extras who form the novel’s rich backdrop, everyone with his or her own engaging biography. From “a friend of my father” (G121), Grigory Grumm-Grzhimaylo (1860–1936), the author of La pamir et sa faune lepidopterologique (1890), who led an Imperial Russian Geographical Society expedition to the Pamirs and the Tyan-Shan, to Charlie Chaplin (1889–1977), the greatest silent comedy actor in fi lm history (G314). Establishing the Difference between Reality and Fiction While some names mentioned by Nabokov are quite obvious and easy to explain, others pose a sort of riddle. For example: “In London, lords and ladies danced the Jimmie and imbibed cocktails” (G315). Unlike the common foxtrot or tango, “danc[ing] the Jimmie” is a mystery, and the commentator wishing to explicate it will have to confront a few possible scenarios: (1) Because Shirin speaks in a lisping voice, Jimmie may be a mispronunciation of the word “Shimmy,” a popular fast dance from the 1920s; (2) “Jimmie” is British slang for the Charleston song and dance and could be a reference to the popular tune’s creator, James P. Johnson (1894–1955) (this African-American composer, pianist, and jazz pioneer wrote the tune in 1923, and it became a hit throughout the 1920s); (3) Jimmie may not be a dance at all, but a reference to an African-American jazz alto saxophonist and bandleader named James Melvin “Jimmie” Lunceford (1902–47), who was noted for Big Band swing music. By 1935, his band, the Jimmy Lunceford Orchestra, had achieved national recognition. Nabokov is blurring the boundaries with the chronology of events and creates a rich and potent context, where an “actual person” meets a fi ctitious one, and the point of contact becomes what Barabtarlo calls “a light-emitting chink.” As a source of contradiction, for it at once emanates — 319 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- credibility and incongruity, Nabokov “purposely and deftly sets up this antinomy. Fact and phantom tinge one another, and although in a good novel the fi ctitious always overcomes and absorbs the factual, the resulting environment is masterly colorable, vraisemblable” (Barabtarlo 17). Literary characters, such as Shakespeare’s Othello or Washington Irving’s Rip Van Winkle, might require some basic explanation, though both have become a part of the cultural canon even for those who have never read the originals. With the greats of Russian literature, things get more complicated: when Nabokov mentions the “voice of Pushkin’s Mary” (G65), the annotator must explain that Mary is the heroine of Pushkin’s drama A Feast During the Plague (1830). But the simple mention of this source may not be enough: Nabokov specifi cally refers to her voice. Therefore, the commentator should consider the opera based on the Pushkin work. Indeed, Mary’s part is performed by a mezzo-soprano in a one-act opera composed by César Cui in 1900. In the midst of a feast, a young man calls for everyone to raise a toast to one of their friends who recently died from the plague. Walsingham, however, asks for a moment of silence in order to request that Mary sing something sad — this particular part is known as “Mary’s Song.” Fake Books, Real Societies Konstantin Kirillovich Godunov-Cherdyntsev’s scientifi c works concerning lepidoptera look deceptively real (take, for example, Lepidoptera Asiatica, a fi ctitious edition allegedly consisting of eight volumes published in parts from 1890 to 1917). Another of Konstantin Kirillovich’s scientifi c works concerning lepidoptera is The Butterfl ies and Moths of the Russian Empire; the fi rst four out of six proposed volumes came out in 1912–16 (G102). Not only invented books, but whole organizations and institutions that appear in the novel sporadically cast their shadows in the imaginary world of the novel: their factual existence is delicately elusive, if not downright dubious. Konstantin Kirillovich Godunov-Cherdyntsev is made a member of the “Imperial Russian Geographical Society” (G103), which, in fact, was established in 1845. The society organized and funded the systematic exploration of the Northern Urals, Kashgaria, Dzungaria, and Mongolia. However, frightened by the revolutionary movements of 1848 in Europe, Nicholas I squelched the formation of even scientifi c societies and meetings, so it was not until after his death that the motion to found the Russian Entomological Society passed. The society was re-launched during the reign of more liberal Alexander ii, and the organizing meeting of the Russian Entomological Society took place on February 25, 1860 (the year Fyodor’s father is born in The Gift) in the offi cial apartment of Superintendent of the Peter-and-Paul Fortress — where Nikolai Chernyshevski will be placed just a few years later. — 320 — ----------------------------------------------------------- Playing with Readers ----------------------------------------------------------- [Ill. 5-2] Library of the Russian Geographical Society in Saint Petersburg, a pre-revolutionary photograph Unreal Becoming Real Not surprisingly, some information found in The Gift is still in the process of verifi cation. A character who might fi rst appear to be entirely fi ctional later turns out to be a real person, as in the case of the American travelers Sachtleben and Allen: “[Fyodor’s] Father loved to recall how once at such a sunset, in 1893, in the dead heart of the Gobi desert he had met with — taking them at fi rst for phantoms projected by the prismatic rays — two cyclists in Chinese sandals and round felt hats, who turned out to be the Americans Sachtleben and Allen, riding all across Asia to Peking for fun” (G120). The Americans authored a memoir about their Asian adventures, but when Alexander Dolinin was preparing his commentary for the Russian edition, the two names were considered an unidentifi ed reference (“Insofar as no biographical information can be found about these men, it is entirely possible that they are fi ctitious,” Dolinin surmises; Kommentarii 674). Luckily, with the recent wave of digitization, some remarkably rare editions have begun surfacing in Google Books and are now available for research purpsoes. An electronically scanned original of Across Asia on a Bicycle (New York: Century, 1894) by Thomas Gaskell Allen and William Lewis Sachtleben is among them. — 321 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- [Ill. 5-3] Across Asia on a Bicycle (New York: Century, 1894) Types of Commentary Commenting on Technique Some passages in The Gift require more elaborate commentary than others. Unraveling meaningful subtexts and providing detailed explanations will assist in greater appreciation of the novel; for instance, the following sentence presents a number of questions at once: “Andrey Bely’s monumental research on ‘half stresses’ . . . hypnotized me with its system of graphically marking off and calculating these scuds” (G151). Who is Bely, what was his research about, and what is the difference between “half stresses” and “scuds”? Andrey Bely is the pseudonym of Boris Nikolaevich Bugaev (1880–1934), a Russian novelist, poet, Symbolist theorist, and literary critic. Nabokov claimed that Bely’s novel Petersburg (1916, 1922) was one of the four greatest works of twentieth-century prose, together with Joyce’s Ulysses, the fi rst half of Proust’s In Search of Lost Time, and Kafka’s “Metamorphosis” (Strong Opinions 57). On a number of occasions, Nabokov praised Bely’s approach to Russian versifi cation (presented in several essays in Bely’s volume Simvolizm [Symbol ism, 1910]). In a letter to Wilson from 1942, Nabokov refers to these writings as “probably the greatest work on verse in any language” (Nabokov–Wilson Letters 78). Further, in the commentary to his translation of Eugene Onegin (Vol. iii, 459), Nabokov acknowledges that he was fascinated by Bely’s essays during his youth. In a letter to his sister (1950) Nabokov reveals that the utility of Bely’s ideas on versifi cation has still not paled for him with the passing years, as he still uses in his teaching at Wellesley — 322 — ---------------------------------------------------------- Types of Commentary --------------------------------------------------------- the tables based on Bely’s system that were fashioned in the Crimea in 1919 (Perepiska s sestroi 62). Commenting on Textual Parallels Despite Nabokov’s categorical judgment in 1966 that Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man was “feeble and garrulous” (Strong Opinions 71), J. Foster maintains that certain external details surrounding Fyodor’s poem about Zina Mertz, which he writes at the beginning of Chapter Three, recall Stephen Dedalus’s villanelle of the temptress: “He lay and smoked, and gently composed, reveling in the womblike warmth of the bed” (G155). Both Fyodor and Stephen “lie in bed as they compose their poems, both have awakened in sordid rooms that clash with their mood of poetic exaltation, both are conscious of returning to a period a decade earlier in their lives, and — most strikingly — both use similar metaphors for the poetic state. Thus Stephen’s triumphant conviction that ‘in the virgin womb of the imagination the word was made fl esh’ is matched by Fyodor’s sense of ‘reveling in the womblike warmth of the bed’ as he composes. And Stephen’s notion that his inspiration radiates outward ‘in cloud on cloud of vague circumstance’ corresponds to Fyodor’s euphoric experience of a ‘pulsating mist’” (G156; Foster 150). If this example presupposes the annotator’s exceptional familiarity with the literary sources that have presumably been used by Nabokov in his writing, the next case, in order to be rightly identifi ed, would require a keen awareness of historical non-fi ction: . . . the unfortunate words which in his youth [Turgenev] had allegedly addressed to a sailor during a fire on board ship: “Save me, save me, I am my mother’s only son.” (G249-50) This accident happened to the young Turgenev in May of 1838. It was described in Pisania I. S. Turgeneva, ne vkliuchennye v sobraniia ego sochinenii (Works not included in his collections. Vol. 3, Moscow, 1916), and reproduced in part in A. G. Ostrovsky’s Turgenev v zapisiakh sovremennikov (Turgenev in the Records of His Contemporaries), Leningrad, 1929. The latter may have served as a starting point for Nabokov: Prince P. V. Dolgorukov thought it fit to unearth an old yarn concerning my crying on board of “Nicholas I,” which burned down near Travemunde: “Save me, — I am my mother’s only son!” (the sarcastic point here is supposed to consist in the fact that I called myself the only son, while I have a brother) . . . This is not my aim to persuade the reader that I was staring at [death] indifferently, yet I did not utter the aforesaid words. (Ostrovsky 40) — 323 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- Commenting on semantic nuances An alternate name that Shchyogolev uses to address his stepdaughter, depending on his mood, is aida (G187). It is true that Giuseppe Verdi’s (1813–1901) opera Aida, about an Ethiopian princess captured and brought into slavery in Egypt, has certain distant parallels with The Gift (the Pharaoh’s military commander, Radames, struggles to choose between his love for Aida and loyalty to his superior; as with the love triangle in the Yasha episode of The Gift, to complicate the story further, Radames is loved by the Pharaoh’s daughter Amneris but does not return her feelings). And yet the main target here is not the famous operatic heroine. A lover of fl at puns, Shchyogolev here hints mainly at Zina’s Jewishness [a-yid = Jew; cf. yid, Yiddish], in this abbreviated form of “Zinaida.” Commenting on Linguistic Obscurity: Puns, Onomatopoeia, Charades In the phonetically playful Russian phrase “polzalo po polu zaly, po kovru, poka vrem” (translated into English as “crawling on all fours along the fl oor of the hall, along the parquet, along the quarpet”; G21) the last syllable changes in the fi nal two phrases (po kovru, poka vrem), while the fi rst two syllables are pronounced identically. Taken literally, as Nassim Berdjis points out, the phrase in Russian means “on the carpet, when we tell lies”; Nabokov plays with rhyming suffi xes of verbs and nouns as in “I walk on the carpet, we walk when we tell lies” (Berdjis 167). This sentence includes a conjugated verb (vrem), but the ending of the adverbial phrase playfully sounds like it might be trying to use the preposition “po” incorrectly with the instrumental case (“po kovrem”); a hearer can easily perceive this as “poka vrem” (= “while we are lying”). In the English version, Nabokov replaces this play on words by rearranging the sounds from “parquet” into its phonetic anagram “carpet” (assuming an Anglicized pronunciation of “parquet”). A similar phrase is also uttered by one of the heroes in Chekhov’s short story “Ionych” (1898): “Ia idu po kovru, ty idesh’, poka vresh’, — Ivan Petrovich was saying while seating his daughter in the carriage, — on idet, poka vret . . . Well, now you can go! Good-bye!” (Chekhov 8: 330). The humor in Chekhov’s phrase comes from a play on the two possible phonetic meanings of the fi rst phrase (Ia idu po kovru = I am walking on the rug; Ia idu poka vru = I am walking while telling lies), which puts the following two statements in a state of limbo between being grammatically incorrect analogs to the fi rst phrase (Ty idesh po kovresh = “You are walking on the rug,” with rug having an impossible noun ending; the “on idet” phrase is the same thing with the pronoun “he”) and being grammatically correct but not analogous to the fi rst phrase (Ty idesh poka vresh’ = you are walking while telling lies). — 324 — ---------------------------------------------------------- Types of Commentary --------------------------------------------------------- Other examples of the linguistic peculiarities in The Gift include specifi cally Russian references pertaining to foreign languages or areas of common knowledge that would otherwise be clear to a native Russian, German, or French readers or speakers, as with the “large, predatory German woman [with] a funny name: Klara Stoboy — which to a Russian’s ear sounded with sentimental fi rmness as ‘Klara is with thee’ (s toboy).” The landlady who rents Fyodor Godunov- Cherdyntsev a room on 7 Tannenberg Street, Berlin, appears with a different fi rst name in the Russian original. In the English variant Zina informs Fyodor: “Your former landlady, Frau Stoboy. She wants you to come over immediately. There’s somebody waiting for you at her place. Hurry” (G352). Nabokov spares readers of the translation from what could be interpreted as unnecessary confusion, but the same phrase looks different in Russian: “Your former landlady, Egda Stoboy” continuing the pun initiated by the quasi-German last name (S + toboi = “with you”). Egda is formed by truncation of the adverb Vsegda (= “always”). An additional irony here is that the one who presupposes being “always with you” calls Fyodor for a meeting with his father’s phantom. In a fi ctitious three- dimensional perspective one can also notice that the missing letters are those standing for the author’s own initials — Vladimir Sirin (noted by Mikhail Bezrodny, in Russian, in his personal blog). Commenting on Theological Concepts the constant feeling that our days here are only pocket money . . . and that somewhere is stocked the real wealth from which life should know how to get dividends in the shape of dreams, tears of happiness, distant mountains. (G164) Nabokov mentions Bergson, awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1927, among the poets and novelists who were his “top favorites” between the two World Wars (Strong Opinions 43). Compare the quote above from The Gift with Henri Bergson’s remarks in The Two Sources of Morality and Religion (fi rst published in 1932) on writers who succeed in capturing “a unique emotion, an impulse, an impetus received from the very depths of things,” perhaps at the expense of “strain[ing] the words” and “do[ing] violence to speech,” and thereby enrich humanity “with a capital yielding ever-renewed dividends, and not just with a sum down to be spent at once” (Bergson 254; noted in Toker 369). Pocket money, dividends, and economics in general, encapsulate mundane reality as a multiplication problem without any real solution (cf. Ecclesiastes 1:2: “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity”). Masataka Konishi has suggested that Alexander Chernyshevski’s delirium “evokes thoughts on religion and mathematical theorems as two related mysterious paradoxes” (28): “Numbers, numbers — and — 325 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- one wants so much to fi nd the biggest number, so that all the rest may mean something and climb somewhere. No, that way you end up in padded dead ends — and everything ceases to be interesting” (G310-311). According to Konishi, “the biggest number” alludes to ideas developed by the mathematician Georg Cantor (1845–1918). Cantor formulated the idea of “the transfi nite number” in his famous article (published as a separate monograph), “Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre” (Foundations of a General Theory of Aggregates) in 1883. He argues that transfi nite numbers are cardinal or ordinal numbers that are larger than all fi nite numbers, yet not necessarily absolutely infi nite. Cantor showed that transfi nite numbers are a systematic extension of natural numbers, and defi ned procedures for their addition and multiplication. Nabokov was interested in mathematical problems and they feature repeatedly in The Gift. The character in Herman Busch’s play declares: “All is number. My bald Pythagoras cannot be wrong” (G67). In memories of his childhood Fyodor suggests: . . . let us describe also the delirious state in which one feels huge numbers grow, inflating one’s brain, accompanied by someone’s incessant patter quite unrel ated to you, as if in the dark garden adjoining the madhouse of the book-of-sums several of its characters, half out (or more prec isely, fifty-seven one-hundred- and-elevenths out) of their terrible world of increasing interests, appeared in their stock parts of apple-woman, four ditchdiggers and a Certain Person who has beq ueathed his children a caravan of fractions, and chatted . . . (G21) The telling comparison of an arithmetical nightmare, “the madhouse of the book-of-sums,” echoes in the scene prior to Chernyshevski’s demise. On his deathbed, Alexander Yakovlevich is preoccupied with similar thoughts: “Religion has the same relation to man’s heavenly condition that mathematics has to his earthly one; both the one and the other are merely the rules of the game. Belief in God and belief in numbers: local truth and truth of location” (G309). There is a striking resemblance between the fates of Cantor and Chernyshevski, who loses his son Yasha and passes on, consumed by insanity. Cantor was born in St. Petersburg in an assimilated Jewish family and moved to Germany when he was 11. His mental illness was partially triggered by his own scientific discoveries of paradoxes that at the time seemed difficult to prove. Soon after his second hospitalization — which coincided with the year of Nabokov’s birth — “while Cantor was delivering a special lecture on the Bacon– Shakespeare question in Leipzig, his youngest son [Rudolph] died suddenly” (Dauben 283). This tragedy devastated the mathematician and his passion for mathematics. Cantor was again hospitalized in 1903 and he was troubled by recurring attacks of severe depression for the rest of his life, being confi ned in asylums. — 326 — ---------------------------------------------------------- Types of Commentary --------------------------------------------------------- The reason why Nabokov was “attracted to strange mathematical conundrums,” Konishi believes, “lies in the metafi ctional aspect of his novels and in his interest in the otherworld”: Nabokov’s “image of the otherworld is not important for the moment; rather, what matters here is how he attempted to verify its existence. Mathematically formalizing it, Nabokov considered the otherworld as something whose existence one cannot prove without falling into contradiction or paradox. To take a simple example, supposing it is true that the otherworld exists, the sentences ‘I am dead’ or ‘The dead are alive’ must be read in the literal sense of the words. In this case, it becomes impossible to decide whether those who say, ‘I am dead’ are in fact dead or alive. However, Nabokov never draws the conclusion that the existence of the otherworld is doubtful from paradoxes such as this. On the contrary, he believes that it exists through such paradoxes” (Konishi 28). Nabokov was not alone in his interest in mathematics — his peers, Russian writers such as Bely, Khlebnikov, and Evgeny Zamyatin (who “hailed Sirin as a dazzling talent” in 1932; Boyd 374), were all experimenting with mathematical laws as applied to contemporary prose and poetry. And before them European thinkers were absorbed in similar problems; it is more to them than to the Russian poets that Nabokov is indebted for the construction of Delalande’s philosophy. Commenting on Philosophical Concepts Obviously Delalande’s Discours incorporates various philosophical postulates, including Bertrand Russell’s well known observation, as pointed out by Omry and Irena Ronen, that: “Physics is mathematical not because we know so much about the physical world, but because we know so little: it is only its mathematical properties that we can discover” (quoted in Ronen, “Diabolically Evocative” 379). The rules of the game are as general and accessible as mathematics, hence the dying Aleksandr Yakovlevich Chernyshevski disposes of religion because it “subsumes a suspicious facility of general access that destroys the value of its revelations” (G310). Another thesis from Delalande’s opus, namely his “free eye,” recalls a famous passage in Ralph Waldo Emerson’s proto-symbolistic essay “Nature” (1836). In The Gift: “Our transformation into one complete and free eye, which can simultaneously see in all directions, or to put it differently: a supersensory insight into the world accompanied by our inner participation” (G310). Compare this with Emerson describing the effect that immersion in nature has on him: “I become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or parcel of God” (Alexandrov 245, 11n). — 327 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- Commenting on Philological Concepts The scholar’s goal is to uncover an intricate web of allusions, but it is the commentator’s mission to demonstrate the synchronic layers of the novel and to point out the details that might be lost for the next generation of readers (this distinction between the scholar and commentator is, admittedly, an artifi cial one, because the two roles are seldom separable). Let us turn to this passage: But a few days later he happened to come across that same copy of 8 X 8 [ . . . ] he ran his eyes over the two-column extract from Chernyshevski’s youthful diary; he glanced through it, smiled, and began to read it over with interest. [ . . . ] the drubbing-in, rubbing-in tone of each word, the knight-moves of sense in the trivial commentary on his minutest actions . . . (G194) Brian Boyd observes that the chess magazine’s title (8 x 8) is “a transparent allusion to the Soviet chess journal 64” (Russian Years 456). The chess publication might also insinuate Victor Shklovsky’s book, Khod konia (Moscow-Berlin, 1923), literally: Knight’s move. The cover of Shklovsky’s book pictured a chess board with a diagram showing the knight’s move. As pointed out by John Malmstad, “it is possible that the idea of writing a biography of Chernyshevski came to Nabokov from the remarks on Chernyshevski’s diary made by Vladislav Khodasevich. In the article ‘Melochi’ (‘Trifl es’) (Vozrozhdenie 2963, July 13, 1933) Khodasevich quoted several passages from the young Chernyshevski’s diary with the aim of showing that the ‘half-ridiculous’ ‘half-pathetic’ ‘seeds’ of the new phenomena of Soviet everyday life and literature were ‘sown’ long before the victory of the Soviet system” (quoted in Paperno 315, 5n). Khodasevich disliked the Formalists, but he took their ideas seriously (Malmstad). Nabokov must have followed this debate closely: the expres sion “knight’s move” not only appears in the novel in the description of Fyodor’s purchase of the Soviet chess magazine, which helps Fyodor to conceive the plan for his biography of Chernyshevski, but refers to the core of the formalist method of “deformation of material” (Ronen, “Putevoditel’ po Berlinu”). In their descriptions of literary development, the Formalists coined the metaphor of the “knight’s move,” another graphic term for the so-called literary evolution: “In opposition to the positivistic notion of a linear course of literary development (progress), the Formalists envisioned it as a curve with a regular pattern of displacement (sdvig), the ‘knight’s move’” (Paperno 297). In The Gift Nabokov presents the development of literature in a similar fashion, explaining in the foreword to the English edition “that the novel’s subject is the creative evolution of its writer-hero, Fyodor Godunov- Cherdyntsev” (Ibid.). — 328 — ---------------------------------------------------------- Types of Commentary --------------------------------------------------------- Commenting on Self-references Passing remarks on geographical locations are numerous in the novel (Kiev, Riga, or the Godunov-Cherdyntsevs’ mansion on the banks of the Neva river), and it would suffi ce to annotate only those that are signifi cant in the context of the work. Such is the case with Leshino, the country estate of the Godunov-Cherdyntsevs, Fyodor’s presumed birth place (G12, 25, 131, 137, 156, 353). The estate lies “ten or so versts” from the nearest station and Fyodor imagines his return from exile, when he will once again walk this distance. Konstantin Kirillovich comes from town to Leshino to bid his family farewell before departing on his fi nal trip to Asia. Literally “Leshino” derives from “leshii” which means “wood-goblin” or “wood-sprite” — according to popular myths, Leshii lives in the forest; he appears frequently as a folk character in nineteenth century art, including the opera by Ostrovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov. Leshii is also the hero of Nabokov’s fi rst prose work, the short story “The Wood-Sprite” (1921). In that story, as later in The Gift, the creature incarnates the idea of lost childhood and Russia destroyed by the Bolshevik revolution (Katz 516). Nabokov’s family estates were in reality situated in places called Vyra and Rozhestveno. [Ill. 5-4] “Leshino” — Rozhestveno: Th e Family Estate of the Nabokovs (2009) — 329 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- Less frequently, it becomes clear that segments of the fi ctional text contain self-references or replicate the author’s own writings only if one has access to documentary sources, such as personal correspondence, diaries, and notes. Nabokov’s long letter to his classmate (reproduced in the Appendix) is an excellent example of such a confl uence between literature and historical documentation in The Gift. Let us take the example of the following excerpt from the novel: . . . during the last days of March . . . in the classroom the large window was open . . . teachers let lessons go by, leaving in their stead squares of blue sky, with footballs falling down out of the blueness. (G106) This is taken almost verbatim from a letter that Nabokov wrote on September 4th, 1937, to Samuil Rozov, his best friend at Tenishev School, who had moved to Palestine. This communication (now in a private collection) contains several autobiographical fl ashes from The Gift, which was being written at the time: “In spring, I remember, teachers let lessons go by leaving as it were squares of blue sky, with a football dropping down out of the blue.” The same type of autobiographical reference is “In den Zelten” street; this is not a mere place in Berlin where the Chernyshevskis once resided (G37), but also the location of an orthodontist whom Nabokov visited in 1910 (who possibly served as an inspiration for Dr. Lawson in The Gift). Nabokov could hardly have expected his audience to be aware of all the personal intricacies related to one or another latent reference or context, but it is the commentator’s task to provide the readers with such keys. The reconstructive efforts should result in a comprehensive annotated edition that will embrace all types of commentary. The Flying Birds of Russian Literature, Or “On the Risks of the Overinterpretation” In the previous chapter we have already noted some guiding principles for making Nabokov’s subtexts and allusions more accessible. Here I would like to expand and apply the commentator’s technique in order to demonstrate how knowledge of particular sources (or, speaking more broadly, the cultural memory to which Nabokov appeals) might elucidate our general understanding of The Gift. As Omry Ronen points out, the phrase “prozrachen, kak khrustal’noe iaitso” (“as transparent as a cut-glass egg”; G22) bears “a distinct resemblance to the magic crystal in H. G. Wells’ fantasy ‘The Crystal Egg’” (Ronen, “Nine Notes”). However, there is one more subtext here, a Russian one that has not yet been commented on: in Ivan Goncharov’s short story “The Month of May in St. Petersburg” (“Mesiats mai v Peterburge”), a certain character “bought an egg of such a monstrous size somewhere — 330 — ---------------------------------------------------------- Types of Commentary --------------------------------------------------------- in Nevsky prospect in a foreign shop at Easter that everybody at home gasped. He fi lled the egg up to the top with candies and brought it to his young sisters for Easter salutation” [“na Sviatoi nedele . . . kupil gde-to na Nevskom prospekte, v inostrannom magazine, iaitso takoi chudovishchnoi velichini, chto akhnul ves’ dom. On doverkhu nabil iaitso konfetami i prines k sestram-devitsam, chtoby pokhristosovat’sa s nimi” (Goncharov 262)]. The location of the shop is the same — Nevsky Prospekt — and in both cases it is “foreign” (inostrannyi), and the physical size of the purchase is emphasized in both (“a Faber pencil a yard long”; G23). One will notice as well that the trademark of the pencil turns out to be a refl ection of the famous gold-and-enamel Easter eggs by Peter Carl Faberge (Leving, “Six Notes” 36). [Ill. 5-5] Th e Faber pencil advertisement Another illustration is the topoi, or the repository of common metaphors that Nabokov shares with his contemporaries and predecessors: The van had gone and . . . There remained next the sidewalk a rainbow of oil with the purple predominant and a plumelike twist. Asphalt’s parakeet. (G29) The fl ying birds of Russian literature make several stops before perching in The Gift. The passage from Vladimir Narbut’s 1922 long poem “Alexandra Pavlovna” reads as follows: Oranzhevye, raduzhnye peria i zhenshchin sudorozhnye glaza, — pavlinia neft ’! [Orange rainbow plumes and convulsive eyes of women, — peacock’s petrol!] — 331 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- That was taken up by Osip Mandelstam in his Egyptian Stamp (1925-28): “Thousands of eyes looked at the petrol-rainbow water, glistening with all the kerosene tints of the mother-of-pearl swill and a peacock’s tail” (Mandelstam 33). There is no evidence that Nabokov borrowed this image from any of the aforementioned authors and, therefore, one should be especially cautious when deciding whether to make it a part of the commentary. Overinterpretation is one of the biggest pitfalls for any commentator of fi ction. Let us take the protagonist Fyodor’s date of birth — July 12, 1900. Julius Caesar, Henry David Thoreau, and the French poet Max Jacob share the same date of birth. This is certainly a pure coincidence and, therefore, should be dismissed; but the fact that Nikolai Gavrilovich Chernyshevski (1828–89), the historical protagonist of The Gift, was born on July 12th, fulfi ls a structural function and has thematic signifi cance in the narrative (see the “Calendar” section in Chapter Four). Certain information might appear to be superfl uous and can easily be omitted, though some readers may want to know the meaning of rare and foreign words (for instance: Yashmak [G96], a face veil worn by Muslim women). But should one also gloss occurrences like “Fedya” (G12; a diminutive form of Russian name Fyodor), or specify that “srazhenie” (G14) in Russian means “battle” (Fyodor compares its sound to that of a spring-operated toy gun being loaded), or that “zwieback” (G10) in the protagonist’s poem is the German word for “twice baked” sliced crisp bread? Experience in teaching The Gift to undergraduate students in North America has shown that contemporary readers’ erudition has decreased dramatically; still, the fact that a reference is not immediately recognizable in a modern context does not in itself mean that it should be included in a commentary. For instance, the word “lividus,” meaning lead-colored, or the term “magnesium oxide” (G72), a solid white mineral used medicinally to relieve heartburn and indigestion, can simply be looked up in a dictionary. The same can be said of terms like “typhus,” “Styx,” and “enjambment” (G75) belonging to the fi elds of medicine, mythology, and poetics respectively (all of the aforementioned examples have been looked up by students when asked to highlight the “diffi cult places”). Equally questionable is the explanation: “Spanish for ‘an unknown woman’” in the case of “Incognita,” a poem by Alexander Blok that is mentioned by Godunov-Cherdyntsev. On the other hand, a diligent annotator might provide a synopsis of the poem and the year of its composition, as well as note other instances when Nabokov alludes to the same text elsewhere (in fact, Nabokov cited Blok’s poem a number of times during his Russian period and later in the novel Ada). — 332 — ------------------------------------------------------ Visual Aids to Commentary ----------------------------------------------------- Visual Aids to Commentary Most scholarly editions come without lavish illustrations, but for a work deeply rooted in a historical context, charts, maps and accompanying illustrations are particularly useful in understanding the material world of a given novel. I will offer here a few typical examples from the dense texture of Nabokov’s novel where the visual aids can provide an additional commentary. the shchyogolevs had # nished their packing; zina had gone off to work and at one O’clock was due to meet her mother for lunch at the vaterland. luckily they had not suggested that fyodor join them . . . (G355) As discussed in chapter 1, the Vaterland was a fashionable and expensive venue. Marianna Nikolavna’s invitation to her daughter is a generous gesture; Fyodor, as an unrelated tenant, does not receive the same generosity. While the average reader probably hardly questions (at least on the fi rst reading) the origins of a restaurant, the multiple insects under mysterious names frequently mentioned in the text of The Gift will certainly puzzle someone who is not steeped in lepidoptera. There is detailed information and distinct image behind each species mentioned in passing. A butterfl y appearing in Fyodor’s poem (“Or those utterly battered Brimstones, / Through transparent woods fl ying”; G24) is the so-called Brimstone Gonepteryx rhamni. Godunov refers to this member of the Pieridae family as “battered” possibly referring to its wing shape with the orange spot often present on the ever-closed wings. These descriptions in The Gift often contain the discoverers’ names: “On the southern slopes we had already met our fi rst interesting butterfl y — Potanin’s subspecies of Butler’s pierid” (G121). Grigory Potanin (1835–1920), a Russian explorer of Inner Asia, led an expedition to northern China in 1884–86 and there collected various biological specimens. In addition, he was the fi rst westerner to report on the West Yugur and East Yugur languages and ultimately published a book on The Tangut-Tibetan Borderlands of China and Central Mongolia in 1893. Some other passages might remain vague without having a clear frame of reference, which Nabokov trusts his contemporary readers possessed. Thus we see Fyodor lying in his bed, seized by creative energy: “he again turned on the light, lit a cigarette, and lying supine, the sheet pulled up to his chin and his feet protruding, like Antokolski’s Socrates” (G56). Nabokov refers here to a specifi c sculpture, “Death of Socrates” (1875, marble), and at the time of writing The Gift he may also have seen the Soviet postcard printed in 1938 (Photograph by A. S. Rochmilovich, edition of 20.000 copies) from the collection of the State Russian Museum in Leningrad. — 333 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- [Ill. 5-6] Brimstone Gonepteryx rhamni [Ill. 5-7] “Death of Socrates” (Postcard, 1938) — 334 — ------------------------------------------------------ Visual Aids to Commentary ----------------------------------------------------- It is similarly important for readers to have in mind the visual prototype for the following description in Fyodor’s reminiscence of his childhood in Russia: “We did have a puppet theater with cardboard trees and a crenellated castle with celluloid windows the color of raspberry jelly through which painted fl ames like those on Vereshchagin’s picture of the Moscow [Ill. 5-8] V. Vereshchagin, Fire fl ickered when a candle was lighted “Th e Moscow Fire” inside—and it was this candle which, not without our participation, eventually caused the confl agration of the entire building” (G13). Vasily Vereshchagin (1842–1904) was a prominent Russian battle painter whose realistic canvases depicting dramatic plots were and still are quite popular in his homeland. “The Moscow Fire” refers to the 1812 burning of Moscow on September 16, shortly after Napoleon’s troops entered the city following the Battle of Borodino, the decisive clash between the Russian and French armies. It is meaningful in the context of Nabokov’s novel that Vereshchagin traveled to Central Asia (his journeys in Turkestan in 1869, the Himalayas, India and Tibet in 1873, yielded a number of paintaings, which Nabokov very likely knew). Like any work of art, even novels with broad appeal such as those of Nabokov or Joyce refl ect their own times, and therefore certain aspects are subject to obsolescence. It is vital for a commentator to annotate the signs of everyday reality in the characters’ surroundings that might become unclear to subsequent generations of readers. When Fyodor receives a giant display model from his mother (“a Faber pencil a yard long and of corresponding thickness”; G23), the commentator can clarify that pencils of the “A.W. Faber” brand were commercially successful in Russia, and the fi rm had stores in both St. Petersburg and Moscow (in fact, the best lead for Faber’s products had been brought from Siberian mines beginning in the late nineteenth century). The brands of bicycles that Fyodor rides (mentioned in his poem) were also available in the Petersburg of Nabokov’s youth — “Pobeda” (“victory” in Russian) and “Dux” (“to lead” in Latin). In their literary conversation, Koncheyev and Fyodor compare Russian belles-lettres to a legendary stallion: “Don’t forget that the whole of Russian literature is the literature of one century and, after the most lenient eliminations, takes up no more than three to three and a half thousand printed sheets, and scarcely one-half of this is [Ill. 5-9] Th e advertisement worthy of the bookshelf, to say nothing of the for “Dux” bicycles (1912) bedside table. With such quantitative scantiness we — 335 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- [Ill. 5-10] Th e cover of Iunaia Mysl’ (No. 6, 1916) must resign ourselves to the fact that our Pegasus is piebald, that not everything about a bad writer is bad, and not all about a good one good” (G71). The origins of Pegasus are well-known (in Greek mythology, he is a winged horse born from Poseidon and the Gorgon Medusa); what the commentator should mention, in addition to this generally available information, is that Nabokov authored two early poems under this title (in 1917 and 1922), and that the Tenishev School journal, Iunaia Mysl’ (Youthful Thought), to which young Nabokov regularly contributed, also featured an elegant drawing of Pegasus on its cover. In general, knowledge of Nabokov’s early creative output is essential for a better grasp of the character of Fyodor. Consider this ironic pseudo-critical — 336 — ----------------------------------------------------------- The Opening Scene ----------------------------------------------------------- review: “We have before us a thin volume entitled Poems (a plain swal low- tailed livery, which in recent years has become just as much de rigueur as the braiding of not long ago — from ‘Lunar Reveries’ to symbolic Latin), containing about fifty twelve-line poems all devoted to a single theme: childhood” (G9). “Lunar Reveries” is a take on Nabokov’s own juvenile poem “Lunnaia greza” (“Lunar Reverie”), which appeared in journal Vestnik Evropy in 1916. The Opening Scene Finally, any discussion of the type and amount of information to include in a commentary on The Gift will ultimately depend on the kind of edition that is pursued, as I touched on briefl y in the fi rst chapter of this book (see “Towards the variorum edition”). If it is designed for study at a college or university, then the samples that set the standard for presentation of world masterpieces to students and teachers should be employed: these editions usually include literary history commentary, backgrounds, sources, criticism, the author’s chronology and a select bibliography. Existing editions for nineteenth century Russian literature include Tolstoy’s War and Peace and Anna Karenina, Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov, Turgenev’s Fathers and Sons, as well as works by Gogol and Chekhov. Considerably less attention has been devoted to the twentieth-century Russian masterworks, except an edition of short stories by Isaac Babel edited by Gregory Freidin in the Norton Critical Editions series (New York, 2009) and the growing number of companions to single literary works; see, for instance, the useful volume by Thomas Seifrid, A Companion to Andrei Platonov’s The Foundation Pit (Boston, 2009), and Julian Connolly’s A Reader’s Guide to Nabokov’s Lolita (Boston, 2009). Nabokov’s The Gift is a quintessential Russian novel that perfectly bridges literary traditions of two centuries. Putting together a critical edition of the English version of The Gift would go a long way toward making its rich texture of literary echoes, allusions, and parodies apparent and accessible to non-Russian speaking audiences who are not conversant with the nuances of Nabokov’s Russian background. Reading as Strolling Versus Reading as Biking The opening of The Gift plays a key role in introducing the reader into the world in which the rest of the work will take place. To a large extent, further understanding of both the sequencing and internal logic of Nabokov’s work on the text, as well as the structural interplay between plot elements and the poetic mechanisms in the novel as a whole, is dependent on successfully applying the technique of slow reading in the fi rst pages and on accurately reconstructing the manuscript variants. Customary reading speed obscures and blocks many of the — 337 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- author’s intentions, while with a slow re-reading we can take into account all of the lexical meanings (both potential and hapax legomenon variants) of the words. Though this approach is often taken when analyzing poetry, it has unfortunately not reached any serious level of development in the Russian humanities tradition, although it has been around for a long time (there is, it would seem, one fortunate exception: a special branch of study in the tradition — Pushkin). In The Wisdom of Pushkin (Moscow, 1919), Mikhail Gershenzon fi rst proposed the method of slow reading. In his article entitled “Reading Pushkin” (1923), he lamented that “reading today resembles a quick ride on a bicycle, with pictures fl ashing past by the wayside, merging and fading out like a motley, undifferentiated procession,” whereas “in bygone days people read more slowly and contemplatively, like pedestrians” (Gershenzon 13). A dense analysis of the textology and semantics of the opening pages of a novel might, in light of a future academic edition, seem patently superfl uous (and to a certain extent this is indeed the case). Although Nabokov’s novel requires, I believe, just such a thorough scholarly apparatus (in terms of both concepts and interpretations) in addition to the generally accepted views, The Gift is still without such a publication and without such commentary. Formatting Conventions Used The methods listed below will be used to signify differences between the source being studied and the canonical text (the lifetime edition with author’s corrections, published by Ardis, Ann Arbor, 1975; English translation in the Vintage edition). Capital letters represent the text of The Gift as published. Italic type in [square brackets] signifi es words and marks that were crossed out in the manuscript. When there is more than one rejected variant, each subsequent version is represented by a subscript number 1, 2, and so on. Versions of lines are presented in sequence, from the initial layer to the fi nal one. Plain text in [square brackets] indicates text that is in the fi nal version in the archive copy but differs from the published version. Insertions written in above the line in the manuscript are presented in {curly brackets}. The corresponding notes are grouped into the following categories: plot points, commentary, themes, motifs, methods, subtexts, and context. Author’s Name, Dedication, Epigraph The author’s pseudonym is part of the semantics of the novel, as is the dedication. All of Nabokov’s novels, with the exception of one that was dedicated to his mother, Elena Ivanovna Nabokova (1876–1939), were dedicated to his wife, Véra Evseevna Nabokova (Slonim).

The epigraph constitutes both the starting point and the design for the novel’s coming confl ict. Commentary: The dynamics of this short text-within-a-text are built on the increasing mobility of the nouns that are listed (from zero potential for movement to the maximum speed likely to be found in the natural world): — 339 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- plant → animal → bird). The notion of a country includes the previous three species (categories of fl ora and fauna), and thus encompasses them all. Death, however, is a cessation — the absolute opposite of the idea of motion — and it stops the movement that had been developing, including on the syntactic level, with the presence of the root beg (running) in the word neizbezhna (inevitable). Death also lends this set of seemingly unrelated phrases a metaphysical dimension. Each of the six items in this chain corresponds to the biblical sequence in the description of the creation of the world. After dividing the light from the darkness and the water from dry land, the plants appear on the third day and the animals and birds on the fi fth day; not until day six did God create man. And it is this link — man — that is missing in Smirnovski’s inserted text. The semantic series suggests the idea of a circle: the epigraph posits a closed cycle of life and energy. Taking this fragment out of its context, Nabokov exposes Smirnovski’s “circle” and undermines it by giving it an ironic distance from its highlighted prototype. Instead of man there is an empty space; instead of birth there is death; instead of a teleological narrative there is a Möbius strip; instead of the Old Testament there is an elementary school reader; instead of an epic hero there is Chernyshevski; and so on, and so forth. Theme 1. Fatherhood. Kin/Family. The subjects associated with the notion of “tree” (here, an oak) include the categories of roots (the father theme) and branches (the continuation of the family). This theme is etymologically present in the word OTECHestvo (from otets: “father), and even more pronounced in the English translation: “fatherland.” The logical progression in each of the fi rst four items in the list is from specifi c to general. In Invitation to a Beheading (1935), Cincinnatus reads a novel by the name of Quercus (Latin for “oak”): “Its protagonist was an oak. The novel was a biography of that oak”; Invitation 122-23). What keeps Cincinnatus from enjoying the novel is “the inevitability of the author’s physical death” (Ibid. 124). Theme 2. The Textbook. The theme of the textbook is introduced in the epigraph to The Gift. The selected excerpt from this textbook (the 17th edition, 1903: 78) by Petr Vladimirovich Smirnovski (1846–1904) is an example of a mute, dead text (it has no verbs in the Russian original because the copular “is” generally gets omitted in Russian). It is also important that Nikolai Chernyshevski himself was the author of a Russian grammar textbook written in the mid-1850s. At the time that Nabokov wrote The Gift, this textbook existed only in manuscripts under the simple title Grammatika (Grammar), but Nabokov did know of it from the book Chronology of Chernyshevski’s Life (Chernyshevskaia-Bystrova 78); excerpts from the textbook were printed in the journal Zven’ia (No. 8, 1951: 506-7). — 340 — ---------------------------------------------- Author’s Name, Dedication, Epigraph ---------------------------------------------- Grammar participates in the principles on which a given text is constructed. In the case of The Gift, we are taught that it is possible to take a patently non- artistic text (a travel account, an intellectual’s diary, a political manifesto) and, without changing a single letter, make it into an artistic text. Transformation of an aesthetic skeleton is also an author’s gift. The text of the novel has to consciously include parts that are repulsive and that one has no desire to reread. The gift of reading is the same gift that we acquire through this novel. The descriptive word that is sought after at the beginning of the novel — immortal — is only found by the reader at the end; the novel might justly have been called The Immortal Gift, and thus represent a response to the epigraph. Theme 3. Discovering the Gift of Speech. The Russian word otrok (“adolescent”) etymologically means non-speaking (i.e., “not having the right to speak,” from the roots ot + reku), much like the Latin infans. A text about the inability to speak is a topos of beginning (education), literally: “from the beginning of speech” (cf. the expository prolog scene depicting the curing of a stutter in Andrei Tarkovsky’s fi lm Zerkalo [Mirror, 1975]: “I can speak!”). Nabokov’s novel — from beginning to end — is a novel about the gift of speech. Motif. The motif of “excusing oneself” is an obligatory rhetorical device in poetic speech: asking forgiveness for the length of the work, for digressions, for appeals to God, man, and so on. But along with all the disclaimers, there is also a desire to learn the language. Methods. An epigraph is, by defi nition, a fragment of something that is well formulated: a poetically organized text that stands out for its rhythm and striking syntax. This excerpt mimics the structure of a syllogism but, unlike the classical form, this one is open-ended, because the fi rst fi ve premises in no way lead to a conclusion. However, the content of the Smirnovski epigraph unwittingly brings to mind the example of Pushkin’s prose, with its synoptic nature and its abrupt shifts in content. Examples from grammar books are what is usually learned by heart and then recited. In children’s folklore, excerpts from textbooks become part of the workings of the oral tradition. Texts that stand out for their phonetic regularity tend to remain in the collective mnemonic tradition for a particularly long time. Nabokov’s book begins with a triple stress (in the fi rst version the title of the novel is Da [Yes]), which unfolds in the sound sequence: Dar — Dub — Der (Dar = [The] Gift, Dub = oak, Der = the fi rst syllable of the word “derevo” — “tree”). If we go back even further, to the fi rst word on the book’s cover, we can also include the fi rst syllable of the author’s pseudonym, Sirin: Sir — Dar — Dub — Der. — 341 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- Readers of various levels perceive the strangeness of the text in the fi rst two or three pages of the novel (the syntax seems artifi cial and the text seems forced). In terms of form, the opening of The Gift is constructed less according to the rules of prose than it is in accordance with verse techniques familiar since ancient times, becoming at times an unfi nished anagram and at others a lipogrammatic text. The epigraph is based on the alternation of nouns of contrasting grammatical genders in the original Russian. If we represent masculine nouns with 1, feminine nouns with 2, and neuter nouns with 3, the sequence is: 1-3, 2-1, 1-3, 1-2, 2-3, 2 + verb. Subtexts. death is inevitable. The syllogistic tone of this closing assertion recalls the Book of Ecclesiastes and reproduces its rhetoric: “For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again” (Ecclesiastes 3:19-20). On the level of the plot, there is a possible reference to the dreams of Joseph (the movement from the world of plants through animals into space; see Genesis 37:6-10), which brings in the themes of exile (Egypt/Germany), the journey far from home, and, as a reward, the meeting with the beloved father, Jacob, after a long separation (though in The Gift, Fyodor’s meeting with his father happens only in a dream). Motifs from the Bible, from mythology, and from the Homeric epics operate on an intertextual level as the author introduces them as “others” relative to his own system of artistic ideas. They are arranged hierarchically above all life events and literary situations and are fundamentally separated from these things in terms of chronology — they are either outside of time or at the beginning of time (Shcheglov 83). Context. Every textbook gravitates towards an alphabetic discourse, with its direct associations: a semiotic system of “signifi ed” and “signifi er.” (Oak is a symbol of the resiliency of life. Rose is associated with innocence, but not without a shade of concealed aggression [and also with a woman’s name]. Birds are agents of death, and so on.) Using this “alphabetic technique,” however, does not deplete the tradition of multiple meanings, and to understand these meanings adequately we must still reestablish the point of view and the range of expectations held by a standard reader in 1934. For example, an oak coffi n (for Pushkin, in the context of memory and death) would inevitably evoke in our hypothetical reader certain ceremonial associations representing the continuity of the tradition on the eve of celebrating the hundred year anniversary of the canonical author’s death (cf. Pushkin’s “Golden chain on that oak . . . ” from Ruslan and Liudmila — Russian — 342 — ---------------------------------------------------------------- Close Reading ---------------------------------------------------------------- literature’s ultimate beginning, and, ad hoc, a paradigmatic children’s text). Certain readers at the end of the 1990s decoded the phrase “An oak is a tree” in part as a macaronic reference to the names of Nabokov’s contemporaries: the father of Russian formalism Boris Eikhenbaum (Eiche = oak; Baum = tree; this was fi rst suggested by M. Kostalevsky), and the pillar of Russian émigré literary criticism, Yuly Aikhenvald, who supported Sirin in his literary youth (Aikh = oak; Wald = forest; this was fi rst suggested by S. Blackwell). And if we search for the deepest roots, we might recall that Dub (oak) is also the last name of a character from among a number of high school teachers, the lieutenant from Jaroslav Hašek’s The Good Soldier Švejk (1921-22), who “was a teacher of Czech during peace time” (“a member of the ‘troika’ of abject idiots and asses. Besides him, this troika included the district superintendent and the headmaster”). In sum — the reader’s feeling of double encoding leads to an understanding that other meanings shine out from behind the words presented to us in the text.

Because the adjective introduces a semantic catalyst in the reader — the question “a cloudy what?” — the word “but” is in this sense somewhat dubious. Every pause has a tendency to be fi lled in with meaning, and the reader immediately fi nds himself in the middle of some sort of action, in media res — and in the place to which he has been led by the instrumental case (in Russian the words for cloudy, luminous, and day are in the instrumental case, which is signifi cantly called tvoritel’nyi padezh — literally the creation case). — 343 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- towards four in the afternoon. As we see from the manuscript, the exact time (3:50 pm, say?) is not of much importance for Nabokov. The Russian — v iskhode chetvertogo chasa — means something like “in the waning of the fourth hour.” The usual rendering of this Russian expression would be na iskhode (~at the waning) rather than v iskhode. This slight stylistic distortion makes us look closely here at a microscopic semantic development. The word Iskhod is also the Russian word for the second book of the Torah — the Exodus — and as such it introduces a fundamental mythopoetic category. The captivity in Egypt is the prototype for all exiles, including the Russian diaspora in Europe between the two World Wars. The émigré community projected their exile from Russia onto the poetics of history complete with the meanings that this brought with it: (1) the destruction of the temple, i.e. Russia, and (2) the diaspora. These associations became part of the cultural aura that defi ned the fate of the Russian émigré settlement. The insertion of this deliberately chosen awkward pronoun, like a mnemonic device, is intended to arrest the reader’s attention; later the context will clip off the meanings that do not work, but for the time being we are simply carving out the rough edges. on april the # rst, 192- (a [one] foreign critic . . . ). Despite the hyphen (in the Russian version an ellipsis), the reader internally continues the numbers in this passage — the question is raised and contemplated. As with all of Nabokov’s riddles, this one has a defi nite answer: the exact digit is established later, not only in the text of the novel, but also by an intrinsic analysis of the expression itself. The truncated series of unknown digits is a variation on the Sophianic number, the mystical trinity: [192-] = (1 + 9 + 2) = 3 (1 + 2) + 3 + 3 + 3 + (9). Simple addition of the known items in the equation: the fi rst day of the month, the fourth month of the year, and one critic (1 + 4 + 1) yields the desired six in the place of the hyphen (in the manuscript Nabokov abandons the number “one” to modify the word critic because this information is self-evident). It should serve as confi rmation for the reader at this point that the next digit mentioned in the text is seven — the street number of the house. most german ones. The English translation is less absolute than the Russian original, which says “all German ones” (vse nemetskie). omit the # nal digit. The Russian word for “digit” is edinitsa, which is etymologically related to the word “one” (odin) and can also mean “an entity,” “a unity,” or can substitute directly for the number one itself. Thus, the theme of categories and beginnings is once again “soldered in” with this edinitsa. The fi rst of April is a carnival day, the end of a fast, and from the 1880s (seen in Chekhov, for example) these associations begin to be overtaken by the connotation of the April fool’s joke. Within the plot of The Gift, this date will play a major role (Fyodor’s less than successful visit to the Chernyshevskis). tannenberg street. A real street in Berlin at the time of writing The Gift. This fi ctional place name — 7 Tannenbergstrasse — would have evoked a painful — 344 — ---------------------------------------------------------------- Close Reading ---------------------------------------------------------------- association for a Russian reader in the fi rst quarter of the twentieth century: the defeat of Russian troops in a battle with the German Army near Tannenberg in 1914 (though it is true that in 1410 the Russians defeated the Teutonic Knights in the same location at the Battle of Grunwald). This historical thread is supplemented by the purely poetic reverberations from the root of the word (Tennenbaum = coniferous tree), which introduces the theme of Russian-German cultural interaction. Cf. Lermontov’s translation (“In the wild north a pine tree / Stands alone on a bare peak . . . ”) of Heinrich Heine’s poem “Ein Fichtenbaum steht einsam” from the collection Buch der Lieder (Book of Songs) (1827). The carol about the Christmas tree (die Tanne) (“O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum, / Wie treu sind deine Blätter. / Du grünst nicht nur zur Sommerzeit, / Nein, auch im Winter, wenn es schneit. / O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum, / Wie treu sind deine Blätter”) might also be among the aural impressions of an urban Russian boy (one popular version of this song from 1824 is that of Ernst Anschütz). This connection also evokes associations with the New Year’s holiday (and thus continues the theme of beginnings, crossing of thresholds, and cycles). In other words, it is not only the confl ict that is important for Nabokov, but also the dialog between cultures. a moving van, very long and very yellow, hitched to a tractor that was also yellow. Finally, the subject of the sentence appears (“van”). The adjective “yellow” denotes a relative characteristic rather than a qualitative one. Something can be pale yellow or bright yellow, but in no way can something be very yellow. In everyday conversational speech, if such a phrase were to appear, it would refer to the intensity or harshness of the color (the shade of a baby chicken). The color yellow generally has negative connotations (director Sergei Eisenstein gathered a special collection of “bad” quotes about the color yellow): in Russian, the expression “yellow house” refers to a mental institution, yellow is the color of infi delity, “yellow press” has a meaning similar to that in English, and so on. The repetition in this passage creates a certain tension or suspense. In addition, the description of the moving van (a kind of centaur made up of a house and a vehicle) on the fi rst page of The Gift not only functions as an imitation of a manuscript — with the inevitable repetitions, awkward alliteration, and clunky, seemingly unpolished style (“a moving van, very long and very yellow, hitched to a tractor that was also yellow; in Russian: “mebel’nyi furgon, furgon ochen’ dlinnyi i ochen’ zheltyi, zapriazhennyi zheltym zhe traktorom) — but also concentrates the theme of the literary process as such. hypertrophied rear wheels. This is typical for vehicles designed for hauling (cf. a steamroller), on which the diameter of the rear wheels is greater than that of the front wheels. The “rear” part of the sentence has by this time grown all out of proportion — the sense of imbalance and sickness conveyed by the adjective is supported by the word “anatomy.” The Russian letter zh (see Russian alliteration — 345 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- noted in the previous paragraph) is generally an impolite one (given its place at the beginning of the Russian colloquial word referring to one’s “posterior,” which is an approximate paronym of the word for yellow, zheltyi). If one were to study the design features of a tractor from 1926, one would very likely discover the presence of something resembling “reproductive organs” (a drain plug or shaft). Around the middle of the 1930s, the word “caterpillar” (after the us company, founded in 1925) was used in Russian as much as the word “tractor.” exposed anatomy. The design of the moving van as it is described is a metaphor for the “exposed anatomy” of the creative text itself (it is symbolic that the manuscript theme is introduced through a dual allusion to Pushkin as early as the third sentence of the novel). The word “shamelessly” in the English translation, which is not stated explicitly in the Russian, strengthens the erotic component. Theme 1. The Birth of Creativity. In addition to foregrounding various types of literary craft that accompany the creation theme, Nabokov introduces the motif of cultural memory. The notion of intertextuality marks the opening of The Gift with a seemingly insignifi cant (but entirely Nabokovian) detail — a means of transportation. Theme 2. Juxtaposition of native vs. foreign (our literature/foreign critics). Motif. on a cloudy . . . anatomy. The motif of creativity is meted out gradually on a syntactic level in this expository scene — in Russian the fi rst and last noun phrases in this long sentence are in the instrumental case — literally, as noted above, the creation case. Methods. The structure borrowed from old Russian prose creates the feeling of comfort that comes with a traditional literary cliché. The hyphen/ellipsis and the omission are one of the stylized features of a classic novel, though the omitted date (1 April 1926) is easily calculated as one reads the novel. The Gift is a bridge that spans the classic nineteenth century Russian novel and the new literature of modernism, and the style of the fi rst sentence can be compared with an elegant salon photograph. The trajectory of the viewpoint on the text’s subject (from high to low: cloud → house number → a moving van at eye level → wheels) echoes the composition of the text, which is built on multiple levels. The next phrase, as any skilful prose writer would have it do, will return the mental viewpoint of the reader back to its accustomed plane. — 346 — ---------------------------------------------------------------- Close Reading ---------------------------------------------------------------- Subtext 1. The opening sentence of Chernyshevski’s What to Do?: “On the morning of July 11, 1856, the staff of one of the large hotels near the Moscow Railway Station in Petersburg was in a quandary, almost in a state of distress” (Chernyshevski 39). Subtext 2. In 1926, in the magazine Russia Illustrated (Illiustrirovannaia Rossiia, No. 26), a prominent writer and Nabokov’s mentor, Sasha Chernyi, published a short story called “The Yellow Moving Van” (“Zheltyi furgon”). Its plot is exceedingly simple: the fi ve-year-old daughter of Russian emigrants gets lost in Paris, and the only thing she can remember about the place where she is living is a big yellow moving van that was parked in front of her hotel in the morning. The focus of the narrative is Russian emigrants and their attempt to blend into the fabric of a foreign city. On a thematic level, the yellow van plays the role of an everyday ornament of émigré life. It is a minute detail and a sign of impermanence: “The van had gone . . . ” (The Gift); “the large yellow van meant for moving furniture . . . had already left” (Chernyi 373). Chernyi’s story was published in the same year in which the action of The Gift begins. Subtext 3. In Ilf and Petrov’s novel The Twelve Chairs (1928), which we know Nabokov thought very highly of, Chapter xiii (entitled “Breathe Deeper: You’re Excited!”) is devoted to the opening of the Stargorod Street railway. The scene begins with the exact date on which the hero emerges from his house into the street (13 months later than in The Gift): “On the morning of May Day [1927], Victor Polesov, consumed by his usual thirst for activity, hurried out into the street and headed for the center” (Ilf and Petrov 108). In the following chapter, Polesov takes Ostap and Vorobyaninov to see Elena Stanislavovna, and when the locals assume that the partners and saviors of Russia have just arrived from Paris, Bender corrects her by saying: “My colleague and I have come from Berlin” (Ilf and Petrov 125). In chapter xiii, the streetcar is not the only means of transportation to play a role: there are also exotic mutant automobiles, including “a truck disguised as a green plyboard locomotive with the serial letter S [in the Russian Щ: Shch]” (Ilf and Petrov 108), a streetcar as depicted by the poet and feuilleton writer Fedia Kletchatyi (My stallion is electric / Better than a fi lly), Gavrilin’s lilac Fiat, and fi nally the Ford station wagon (polugruzovik, literally — half-truck) of the fi lm crew. In the episode depicting the ceremonial opening of the city’s street rail system, there are also a number of less signifi cant details scattered about that might also be associated with the beginning of The Gift: the effi gy of Chamberlain carried by the demonstrators, which was “being beaten on the top hat with a cardboard hammer by a worker possessing a model anatomical physique” (Ilf and — 347 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- Petrov 109) and which had an inscription on the top hat with the words “League of Nations” — the key terms here: anatomical and inscription (the relationship between inside and outside); threes are emphasized in this chapter: the surname of the character Tre-ukhov, his “three-quarter turn”; three passengers (“this was followed by a truck carrying three members of the Communist youth league in tails and white gloves” [ibid.]), and the “three glasses of vodka” that Treukhov drinks (cf. the tribute to The Twelve Chairs in the form of the “three blue chairs” pulled from Nabokov’s van in sentence 24 of the novel). After the three glasses of vodka, Treukhov “turned crimson” (cf. the color of the movers in The Gift) and launched into a tirade against the bourgeois press (“Those acrobats of the press, those hyenas of the pen! Those virtuosos of the rotary printing machine!”; Ilf and Petrov 123); cf. the our literature / foreign critics theme). Treukhov’s efforts to establish the streetcar are a parody of literary labor (“The decision taken on the Friday was favorable. But that was when the trouble started” [literally — “the pains of creation began”]; Ilf and Petrov 113), which pales in comparison with the art of the Moscow fi lm crew that jumps out of their truck (their appearance recalls the couple who had hired the movers in The Gift — one of the men has on an elegant sleeveless leather coat, and the other is the owner of a long scarf in the style that Bender calls “chic moderne” (Ilf and Petrov 122). Context. The novel is constructed as a cycle along the lines of the epigraph. The fi rst word in the Russian text is cloudy and the last word is cloud (translated in the English as “haze”) followed by a stage direction for the reader to return to the beginning (“nor does this terminate the phrase”). (2). the van’s forehead bore (lit. — on the forehead of the van was seen) [WAS] a star-shaped ventilator. running along its entire side was the name of the moving company in yard-high blue letters (lit.- characters) [LETTERS], each of which (including a square dot) was shaded laterally (lit. — from the left) 1[FROM THE RIGHT] 2[WITH THE WESTERN EDGE OF EACH SHADED] with blue paint: a dishonest attempt to climb into the next dimension. Plot point. Scene one: the moving van containing furniture is parked across from the house. Commentary. bore (lit. — was seen). In the fair copy Nabokov uses the word vidnelas' (was seen), with the root “vid,” instead of the neutral auxiliary verb byla (was), thus reinforcing the motif of vision. This is further strengthened by an anagram of the — 348 — ---------------------------------------------------------------- Close Reading ---------------------------------------------------------------- word for vision (zrenie) contained in the last word of the sentence, dimension (izmerenie). star-shaped ventilator. This is yet another mechanical device in the parade of technological advancements put forth by the author. This capacious image (a rotating star) anticipates what follows — a hole in space. In Russian, ventiliator, in addition to being a pretty word, also more or less rhymes with the word traktor. (including a square dot). Nabokov’s technique here is to announce a coming metaphor in the preceding phrase. Readers of Nabokov’s prose must pay close attention to such junctures and these sorts of “announcements” (akin to the psychological effect produced by visual stimuli in some fi lms of the 1960s, when shots from the end were spliced into the fi lm at much earlier points). A dot turns into a circle, and the circle turns into a square. Turning a circle into a square is, in essence, a manifestation of the notorious “next dimension.” The situation involving the unlawful attempt to reach the next dimension is directly demonstrated by this very parenthetical text with the phrase “including a square dot.” A square dot (.), or a dot squared (.)3, both graphically and mathematically illustrates the notion of a three-dimensional cube [X3]: the dot squared, when combined with the shading, appears to be a dot cubed. We recall that on a child’s alphabet blocks, the same letter is applied to all sides of a cube (the theme of grammar and learning to read). attempt to climb into the next dimension. Nabokov here formulates the overarching goal of his metanovel, and this statement thus serves as the creator’s admission regarding his own composition. The optical illusion of depth in a commercial design is usually created by shading the letters from the left (not from the right as the author initially wrote), that is — adding a dark area to the edge of the letters to create the illusion of three dimensions. As we see, in the English version Nabokov simply refuses to specify the side (shaded laterally). Nabokov had to abandon the use of the cardinal direction (western) because he had earlier used the phrase “west part of berlin”; however, this “west — shadow” connection concealed in the manuscript partially explains the societal nature of the area in which the emigrant Fyodor Godunov- Cherdyntsev fi rst settles (in contrast to the light bourgeois downtown — this area is dark, marginal, and less prestigious). Theme 1. Initiation. The fi rst chapter contains all the ur-phenomena of the narrative — it serves as an introduction to the grammar of The Gift and to Nabokov’s own language. Theme 2. Transportation. In the introduction to his English translation of Eugene Onegin, Nabokov wrote: “Pushkin has likened translators to horses changed at the posthouses of — 349 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- civilization. The greatest reward I can think of is that students may use my work as a pony” (Nabokov Eugene Onegin X). The art of literary translation — a type of literary process that makes it possible to transform and adapt the original (a moving van metamorphosed into a horse). Means of transportation in Nabokov often occur as an intertextual mechanism for carrying literary allusions and traditions (Leving, Train Station — Garage — Hangar 11-16). Methods. The prose narration of The Gift is packed with poetic techniques. Parallelism and contrast are used as procedures for deriving simple semantic fi gures from etymological meanings. Subtext 1. the van’s forehead bore a star-shaped ventilator (lit. — on the forehead of the van was seen the star of a ventilator). Cf. Pushkin’s “And on her forehead shines a star” (Pushkin, Skazka 456/The Tale of Tsar Saltan). Once again, Nabokov hooks the reader by using a different preposition than the one the Russian audience would be conditioned to expect from childhood: Nabokov has na lbu (on the forehead) while Pushkin has vo lbu (~in [her] forehead). The metaphor of a “van’s forehead” describes the part of the cargo compartment that sticks out above the cab of the vehicle. For the untrained Anglophone reader who does not recognize the reference to Pushkin’s canonical image, the trope is replaced by a relative construction using an adjective (a star-shaped ventilator). Subtext 2. Brian Boyd sees the moving van as a reference to Gogol’s britzka from the opening of Dead Souls, where the muzhiks discuss how far it will get on those wheels: “From fi rst page . . . The Gift also pays tribute to, takes issue with, or tries to transcend other literary works . . . The fi rst page of The Gift — the hypertrophied rear wheels of the tractor . . . is Nabokov’s tribute to one of the great moments in Russian literature” (Boyd 465-66). Subtext 3. yard-high blue letters. Both Sasha Chernyi and Nabokov have a yellow moving van for carrying furniture. The name of the moving company in The Gift is on the side of the van, and for the time being the protagonist can read it but the reader of the novel cannot. The motif of letters that vanish and then reappear is an important one (“ . . . in somewhat the same way as the jumbled letters fi nd their places in a fi lm commercial”), and it is also found in Chernyi’s short story. When a policeman asks the lost girl her last name, she tells him: “Shcherbachenko. — Huh? — Shcher-ba-chen-ko. — What’s the fi rst letter? Shch — 350 — ---------------------------------------------------------------- Close Reading ---------------------------------------------------------------- (Russian: Щ). Hmmm . . . There’s no such letter in the French alphabet” (Chernyi 373). In his poem “Iubileinoe” (“Anniversary Poem”), the futurist Vladimir Mayakovsky suggested sending the lyrical poet Semyon Nadson, who barged into the alphabet between him and Pushkin, “somewhere out by Shch!” (Leving, “Nabokov i Sasha Chernyi” 52-57) (Щ, the 27th letter of the Russian alphabet, appears towards the end with a number of other little-used letters). The passage from Ilf and Petrov’s novel is interesting in this regard: “a truck disguised as a green plyboard locomotive with the serial letter S [Russian: Shch] kept running into the music workers from behind, eliciting shouts from the bowels of the locomotive in the direction of the toilers of the oboe and fl ute” (Ilf and Petrov 108). The series Щ (shch) marking was used on locomotives designed by N. L. Shchukin (1848–1924). This series was manufactured beginning in 1905, and by the middle of the 1920s was already considered an obsolescent design and, therefore, discontinued. Nabokov, it would seem, noticed the game his predecessors were playing with this letter, taking it to a level of pathos, which was in itself a manifestation of a “hypertrophied” technique of literary borrowing. The moving van travels from Paris to Berlin — or, if you will, from one capital of Russian émigré literature to another — and then from Berlin to the new Soviet Stargorod — and then back into the space of Nabokov’s Berlin novel. This fantastic route, in and of itself, begins to demonstrate the attempt to climb into the next dimension. In the big picture, this text within a text performs the same function as subtitles, and the fact that this parallel with cinematic text is not accidental is attested to by the ice cube-screen that appears in Nabokov’s sentence 19 and, it seems, is also an isomorph of The Twelve Chairs, just like the tractor-van and the truck-locomotive. When the camera crew at the end of Chapter xiii fi nally makes it to Stargorod to shoot the opening of the streetcar line, the authors parody the birth of a cinematic text: “‘Yes, yes, we are a little late. We came across some good nature shots. There was loads of work. A sunset! But, anyway, we’ll manage. Nick, lights! Close-up of a turning wheel. Close-up of the feet of the moving crowd. Lyuda, Milochka, start walking! Nick, action! Off you go! Keep walking, keep walking!.. Comrade Treukhov? Would you mind, Comrade Treukhov? No, not like that. Three quarters.

COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- Plot link. The theretofore unnamed hero, Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev, newly arrived to his new apartment, observes his future neighbors. Commentary. I myself will be living. Up to this point, the narrative has used past tense- -here, there is a jump into the future. This is the fi rst time that the all-seeing omnipotent author appears in the frame of the text, painting himself into the periphery of the pictorial canvas (a compositional device familiar from the works of Velázquez and Van Eyck). The author has already been announced, but the reader has for some time been unaware that he, the author, will be the main character. Thus far, this is similar to the role of the narrator in Dostoevsky, with the usual “eavesdropper” characteristic of Russian novels, who is present in all scenes, as it were, but who, nevertheless, is never seen by anyone. having come outside to [where] their furniture [was waiting] [vyidia navstrechu svoei mebeli]. In this phrase, with its German syntax, the reader should experience discomfort and uncertainty (the assumed questions being: Whose? What furniture?). In the dramatic space the fi rst person appears, and two more are behind him. Against the background of the city landscape, a human triangle becomes visible. Dziga Vertov was studying the device of “life caught unawares” at about the same time (not only are bystanders shown that they are being photographed at the cinema, but their reactions are also imprinted onto the camera’s fi lm). The furniture is a prop for the upcoming narrative (metaphor: the narrative is “furnished” with characters and becomes cluttered with connections). For the meantime, the quadrangular form (the van, building, dresser, and suitcase) predominates among the objects — these are all potential containers. in my suitcase. The suitcase is yet another volumetric cube, setting forth the “boxiness” theme. Further along in the novel, there will be many kinds of containers, including the “Matryoshka doll composition” (the ironic image of the nameless “Russian thinker with a suitcase” will fl ash by momentarily in the novel’s fi fth chapter, not long before the end of the novel). The little suitcase with its modest contents is not only a surface play on words (bel’e [laundry] — chernovik [manuscript — rough copy] — belovik [fair-copy manuscript]), but also forms an anagram with other objects in the scene (mebel’ [furniture] — bel’e [laundry]), and is a slight phonetic provocation (chemodan [suitcase]/chernovik). Via a network of references to a series of chrestomathic sources, this image constructs the central idea of a literary text (or of a book in general) in the form of a sort of travel bag/box — or a curious depositary of texts with free access. In the age of modernism, the space itself of Russian literature in its auto-meta- descriptive moments serves as a suitcase fi lled with manuscripts (an early example being Rozanov’s literary refl ections assembled into “boxes,” and a later one, Sergei — 352 — ---------------------------------------------------------------- Close Reading ---------------------------------------------------------------- Dovlatov’s collection Suitcase, organized in such a fashion that each separate item in the author’s suitcase functioned as a springboard to the next story in the cycle). All of the wordplay is completely lost in the English translation, but Nabokov uses italics in the phrase “in my suitcase,” hinting at the existence of other suitcases. more manuscripts than laundry. As is seen in the rough-draft manuscript, Nabokov at one stage of working on the text rejects another play on words — “only for a zolotnik of laundry” — seemingly because of its obvious scabrousness. Among the defi nitions of zolotnik in Dahl’ is “womb, uterus” (this meaning could successfully work for the image of the container and the theme of birth, as with the narrator of Ivan Bunin’s “Story with a Suitcase” (1931) who hurried “as if to a lovers’ meeting” toward his new purchase: “[the suitcase] stood before me in all its splendor: big, heavy, durable, well-made, with that amazing lustre of magnifi cent new leather. . . . You can easily imagine the feeling with which I opened it, laid it fl at, gazed on its virgin interior, the big pocket made of dark red morocco lining on the upper half!” (Bunin 220); in his introduction to his memoirs, Nikolai Nabokov describes various kinds of traveling bags, trunks, and suitcases (noting the Tatar origin of chemodan--suitcase) that belonged to the Nabokov family, pointing out in particular his mother’s nécessaire: “It was made of dark-red saffi an leather . . . [Nécessaire] opened like a ripe fruit, like the loins of a goddess, the two halves of its cover falling gently apart and offering its enchantments to the gaze of the onlooker” (Nicolas Nabokov 6-7). In the classic dictionary defi nitions, zolotnik can mean either a brocade sarafan, or a unit of weight equal to “about 1/96th pound.” The latter meaning leads Nabokov to play with categories of weight: “a pood of manuscripts” (compare the saying that Dahl’ introduces with the defi nition: “Misfortune arrives by the pood, but leaves by the zolotnik”; a pood weighs about 36 English pounds; this is something like saying, “it comes in big buckets, but leaves only by drops”). However, having sacrifi ced the word zolotnik, he also discards pood as unnecessary. Let us note that, had the original intention held, this would have allowed Nabokov to conveniently introduce the theme of commerce via the seme ‘gold’ (zoloto) (and, in fact, both “underwater gold” and economics would soon appear, with the themes of cheating in weight, hired workers, and the like). Theme. Three-dimensionality. Suitcase/van/book — these are different incarnations of the cubic form, with which the theme of the third dimension is continued (in terms of the viewer’s perception — stereoscopy). Methods. The phrase is constructed emphatically due to the grammatical contrast. The obvious delay of the subject until the end provides a concatenation to the following sentence, which “blurts out” the new subject: “The man . . . .” — 353 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- Subtext 1. In the foreword to the English translation of A Hero of Our Time, Nabokov points out the “involute structure” in Lermontov’s narrative, which anticipates (and Nabokov passes over this in silence) the structure of The Gift, providing the attentive reader one of the keys to Fyodor’s suitcase. In Lermontov’s “Bela,” we fi nd: I was travelling post from Tiflis. The only luggage I had on my cart was one small portmanteau half-filled with travel notes on Georgia. Luckily for you most of them have been lost, but luckily for me the portmanteau and the rest of my things have survived. (Lermontov 5) Following this is a description of a valley in the Caucasus — material and inspiration for the future descriptions of the travels of the elder Godunov- Cherdyntsev. Subtext 2. Dostoevsky writes about manuscripts and laundry in The Insulted and Humiliated. Although its hero is said to carry, in a pillowcase (owing to his lack of a briefcase), “papers” and not manuscripts, it is of course meant that they are manuscripts. This is not [in] the fi rst chapter, but the ninth; nevertheless, the beginning of the story is in present tense, to which the narrator returns after a (nine-chapter-long) excursion into the past. The action occurs, as in The Gift, in springtime: All that morning I had been busy with my papers, sorting and arranging them. For want of a portfolio I had packed them in a pillow-case. They were all crumpled and mixed up. Then I sat down to write. I was still working at my big novel then; but I could not settle down to it. My mind was full of other things. (Dostoevsky 69) Subtext 3. Near the end in Fathers and Sons, Bazarov says portentously to his younger friend Arkady: You see what I’m doing: it turns out there’s empty space in my suitcase and I’m stuffing hay into it. That’s just how it is in the suitcase of our lives; it doesn’t matter what you stuff in, as long as there’s no empty space. (Turgenev 140) The “metaphysics of the traveling bag” is a well-established motif in Russian literature. The layering of subtexts by Lermontov, Dostoevsky, and Turgenev allows one to suppose that they (and others, too) are the very “manuscripts” that fi ll the writer’s briefcase of Nabokov’s hero. — 354 — ---------------------------------------------------------------- Close Reading ---------------------------------------------------------------- Context. The pragmatics of communicating a preamble saturated with reminiscences consist of the following: the main character of the narrative is a storyteller. Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev will write, in order, the story of his father’s trip to Asia, and next the life of Chernyshevski; he will also apparently turn out to be the author of the novel, The Gift, that we are reading. (4). the man, arrayed in a rough greenish-brown [WOOL] overcoat [LODEN COAT] to which the wind o[AND THE HIGH POCKETS] 1[POCKETS THAT HAD SWALLOWED HIS HANDS] 2[IN WHOSE CUTOUTS] 3[INTO WHICH HE HAD TUCKED BOTH HANDS] imparted a ripple of life, was tall, beetle-browed and old, with the gray of his whiskers turning to russet [A YELLOWISH COLOR] in the area of the mouth, in which he insensitively held a cold, half-defoliated cigar butt. Plot point. As before, the plot is still at its starting point. The cameo role of the couple standing by the entrance to the house amounts to a narrative vignette, and these characters fulfi ll no plot function and do not enter into the novel again except as phantom neighbors or in Fyodor’s reminiscence. Commentary. arrayed. The Russian original uses the adjective oblachennyi, which grammatically and semantically echoes the word oblachnym (“cloudy”) from the fi rst sentence. The overcoat behaves like a cloud (the man is not simply dressed; he is as if surrounded by the overcoat — “a cloud in a coat,” so to speak). Another change was made based on the poetic principle of emphasizing sound patterns: oblachennyi — oblachnyi — voilochnoe (Nabokov, as we see in the manuscript, abandoned the adjective “wool” (sherstiannoe) in favor of “felt” (voilochnoe), which is translated as “rough.”). greenish-brown. The next in a series of color strokes (green follows yellow in the spectrum; here it anticipates the green pupil and the greengrocer from the 10th and 12th sentences of the novel. Yellow + gray + green + brown is a range of colors with slightly negative connotations (cf. “gray-brown-raspberry” [sero-buro- malinovyi] — a Russian expression for something having a nondescript color). rough . . . overcoat [lit. — felt overcoat]. As we see, in the English translation Nabokov decided to convey the coat’s texture instead of naming the material, and to this end chooses the ambiguous word rough, which may refer either to coarse, ragged, or unfi nished cloth, or to a rough copy or rough draft of a manuscript. There is a similar play on words in the Russian title of Victor Shklovsky’s Mater’ial i stil’ v romane L’va Tolstogo ‘Voina i mir’ (Moscow: Federatsiia, 1928) (Material and Style in Lev Tolstoi’s novel ‘War and Peace’). — 355 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- the wind imparted a ripple of life. The key here is the “ripple of life” (in Russian, this is expressed by the adjective ozhivliaemoe — animated or enlivened). The static picture is gradually beginning to gather some internal kinetic energy. cigar butt. The sentence develops by using close-ups of increasing size, like a nesting box or onion composition: cigar butt Æ mouth Æ beard Æ overcoat. The cigar butt is enlarged more than any other detail to this point. To see a “half- defoliated” cigar, one needs to change focus; thus we have here not a simple zooming in, but an extreme close-up. insensitively held the cigar butt. In a metonymic way, this adverb creates a tone of coolness relative to these two people, despite the fact that they are described quite objectively (bowlegs). Theme 1. Betrayal, falseness, inconstancy. In the European tradition of visual art, having reddish hair (“russet”) is negatively marked: Judas is always red-haired in paintings and frescoes (the color was also adopted in the icon painting). The Russian word ryzhevatost’ is clear, but in the translation Nabokov chooses the more neutral russet, presumably because this word can also refer to a coarse, homespun wool cloth of a russet color (and thus it echoes the overcoat and, by extension, the rough draft). Let us take note of Nabokov’s technique here: when a pun or a subtext is muted or lost in one place, he tries to compensate for it in other places nearby, using whatever methods are available in the target language of the translation. Theme 2. Cinematographer. This sentence creates in the reader a sense of the type of movement associated with cinematographic techniques (if not exactly with modern computer graphics). Theme 3. Palimpsest. In Russian as in English, the word for leaves (list’ia) can also refer to pages — thus the fact that a cigar is rolled from leaves of tobacco points to the combination in The Gift of various types of texts, narrative points of view, chronological layers, geographical spaces, and narrative axels. Motif. The burning cigar is a symbol of urbaneness and also of the natural cycle. A “half-defoliated” cigar brings to mind autumn and the anticipation of an ending. Methods. Reduction: the gaze rests at the end on an object on its way out. The reader will later have to return to this “frame.” — 356 — ---------------------------------------------------------------- Close Reading ---------------------------------------------------------------- Grammatical overlap (in the Russian the words oblachennyi [arrayed] and poluobletevshii [half-defoliated] clearly echo each other), accompanied by parallel attributes (a man wrapped in an overcoat and a rolled cigar). The metaphor of undressing: the striptease applies even to the cigar (in the following sentence the subject’s gaze will be moved to a woman’s legs). It is possible that Nabokov is playing with an omitted component of the saying about old men susceptible to seduction — the fi rst half of the saying — “Gray in the beard, a beast in the bosom” (Sedina v borodu, a bes v rebro) — is clearly present in the phrase gray of his whiskers (sedina v borode). Subtext. In Lermontov, right in a scene involving an author moving (!), a group of Ossetian movers appears with Maksim Maksimych: “He looked about fi fty. His swarthy complexion . . . his prematurely grey whiskers accorded ill with his fi rm step and brisk appearance. I went up to him and bowed. He returned my bow in silence and puffed out an enormous cloud of smoke” (Lermontov 6). In The Gift, the coat of this man (with gray in his whiskers and a cigar in his mouth) seems to be a euphemistic description of an ordinary overcoat, while the “swarthiness” of Captain M. M. corresponds to the “pseudo-Chinese face” of the man’s companion in The Gift. (5). the woman, thickset and no longer young, {with bowlegs} and a rather attractive [FALSELY-] pseudo-chinese face, wore an astrakhan jacket; the wind, having rounded her, brought a whiff of [SHE SMELT OF] rather good but [SOME SORT OF LONG-HELD] slightly stale [stale] perfume. Plot point. The heroine (a fi gure in close-up — a cut from the previous scene; a montage splice) evokes a series of reactions in the narrator. Commentary. the woman. A contrast is introduced using the woman as an example: she has unfortunate legs but, on the other hand, a pleasant face. astrakhan jacket. The Russian adjective used here is karakulevyi which, like the English translation astrakhan is associated both with a fur cloth and with a place name: Karakul introduces the theme of Eurasia to the Russian ear (in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Astrakhan was a border city in the Muscovite Empire, which served as its gateway to the East). The texture of the jacket also conceals a meta-descriptive etymological pun on the Russian word karakuli (hieroglyphs, scribbles, etc.) and thus continues the theme of manuscripts. whiff of perfume. Smell becomes an additional dimension (the “next dimension”). The text begins to “emit an odor.” — 357 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- Theme 1. Loss of individuality. The image of this cameo pair and the breaking up of their features does not bode well. Any attempt to construct a composite picture of each of them individually would not prove successful. Theme 2. Fluctuation of things; instability of matter. The wind staggers the man and “rounds” the woman. Everything is fl owing and changing — the cloud loses its shape, things disappear, and the half-defoliated cigar burns up; this is life itself. Theme 3. Predicting a journey. (A) The Chinese theme in a false, reversed, parodic variation; (b) something unreal, pseudo-authentic. Motif. The coldness and insensitivity of the man. The basic scheme: an “unequal marriage” (he is an old man, she is much younger). A caricature of German burghers in the style of the illustrated weekly Simplicissimus or the humor section of the émigré journal Russia Illustrated (Illiustrirovannaia Rossiia). Methods. The semantics in the sound play gradually instill in the reader a sense of uncertainty and caution about what is happening. In the Russian, the repetition of kar and similar sounds sets in: korenastaia — krivymi — krasivym — karakulevyi (the words translated as “thickset,” “bow[legs],” “attractive,” and “astrakhan” respectively). The Turkic lexeme kara means black (cf. Karamazov). There is a second semantic dominant in this passage: pakhnul — neplokhie — zatkhlovatye — dukhi (“brought a whiff of,” “rather good,” “somewhat stale,” and “perfume” respectively). The subjectivity of the text increases in the fi fth sentence. The perspective still belongs to an outsider and not yet to the suggested observer, but his presence becomes more and more palpable as more evaluation gets introduced into the text (evaluation of appearances, the smell of the perfume, etc.). (6). they both stood motionless and watched # xedly, with such attentiveness that one might think they were about to be shortc hanged, as three red-necked husky fellows in blue aprons wrestled with 1[SET ABOUT UNLOADING] 2[UNLOADED] their furniture. Plot point. The movers carry the furniture from the van into the house. — 358 — ---------------------------------------------------------------- Close Reading ---------------------------------------------------------------- Commentary. motionless. The couple is frozen (a still frame), and against that background appear new protagonists with formulaic movements. Thus a confl ict is laid out directly within a single sentence. three red-necked husky fellows. There is something butcher-like about these fellows from the service sector (partly because of the Russian verb obvesit’ — literally “to hang,” also, colloquially, to give a customer less of something than what they are paying for, here translated as “shortchanged” — and partly because of the color red). red-necked. The “stiff-necked” are a biblical trope (see Psalm 75:5). The word “red” (krasnyi) in Russian can be ambiguous: it is not always clear whether it means “beautiful” (the historical meaning of the word krasnyi), and when it simply refers to the color (in this scene it may refer to the color of the company shirts worn by the movers, sunburned skin, etc. The latter interpretation is clearly the most likely in the English, but this is not the case in the Russian). In light of the previously mentioned subtext from Ilf and Petrov (the “three members of the Communist Youth League in tails” in the car), the color red also carries the suggestion of an ideological meaning. There is typically a “beautiful maiden” (krasna devitsa), and so, in this amalgam of idioms, there are “beautiful fellows” (krasny molodtsy, close to the krasnovyinye molodtsy in the original Russian). wrestled with. The Russian verb here is odolevat’ — meaning something like “defeat” or “conquer.” Thus we have the connotation of a military exploit, and the number of the movers (the archetypal number of bogatyrs in Russian folklore is three) reinforces the folk epic tone in the scene. The clean, primary colors (red, blue) presume a certain amount of caricature in this depiction and specifi cally seem to point to the lubok — a type of cheap woodblock print popular among Russia’s lower and middle classes in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Theme 1. Construction. The topos of building will gradually be developed over the course of the novel. In the text, as in mythology, we see the ritual of building a human. For now, the separate members — forehead, face, legs, neck — are being gathered up (cf., in Egyptian mythology, the dismemberment of Osiris’ corpse, which is gathered together in pieces to conceive Horus. The infant then grows and gathers his forces in order to revenge himself on Set for the death of his father). Theme 2. Settling in a house. What happens is not simply the protagonists moving into a new home, but also the stage fi lling up with the dramatis personae; the extras help the author — 359 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- prepare that area for the unfolding of the plot. In this sense, in the sixth sentence of the novel Nabokov is already departing from classical tradition by revealing a little bit of the supporting structure. Motif. one might think they were about to be short changed. Here the theme of commercial interactions is introduced. The English translation uses the verb “short-change” (differing slightly from the Russian obvesit’ — see note above); shortly after this, Fyodor will go shopping and get small change in return. Methods. The feelings of readers are produced by words — roots, morphemes, and prefi xes. For now, the feeling is of that which is incomplete and illicit; all around there is either deceit (short-changed), or inferior and non-functional things (an extinguished cigar butt, hypertrophied wheels, bow legs). Context. Later in the fi rst chapter, similar motifs will be repeated in one bundle of words — in the parody of an image from an advertisement: someone is “holding in his brawny hand, with a carnivorous grin, a sandwich containing something red (‘eat more meat!’) . . . ” (G13). (7). some day, he thought, I must use such a scene to start a [NOVEL] good, thick old-fashioned thing [BOOK]. the * eeting thought was touched [HE THOUGHT] with a careless irony; an irony, however, that was quite unnecessary, bec ause [ALREADY] somebody within him, on his behalf [ON BEHALF OF FYODOR KONSTANTINOVICH], independently from him [FROM FYODOR KONSTANTINOVICH], had absorbed all this, recorded it, and # led it away. Plot point. The protagonist relates the observed developments in the outside world to a plan for an artistic work. Commentary. some day . . . to start. Despite the growing feeling that the novel has started to roll, we are continually withdrawn once again — this whole passage is written in subjunctive (in English, this is accomplished with the modal “must”; in Russian with a subjunctive construction using an infi nitive: vot tak by nachat’). thing. In Russian, the word shtuka (thing) is another archaizing element, a stylization based on nineteenth century classics. The “thing” remains untouched. — 360 — ---------------------------------------------------------------- Close Reading ---------------------------------------------------------------- on his behalf. The reader is meant to experience a small stylistic shock from this sudden and unpredicted switch from the fi rst to the third person singular pronoun [“I” → “He”]; this is the fi rst signal of the hero’s future bifurcations reinforced in the next sentence by the use of an ordinal number (“for the fi rst time . . . ”). The English translation introduces Fyodor one sentence earlier than in the Russian original, where an impersonal verb is chosen (“podumalos’” instead of “on podumal”/“he thought”). [ON BEHALF OF FYODOR KONSTANTINOVICH]. Nabokov weighed the possibility of un- mask ing the main character at this early stage, but in the end refused to go through with this idea, and for now keeps his name hidden (postponing the moment at which the narrative “I” is personalized until the 45th sentence of the novel). absorbed all this, recorded it, and # led it away. The idea of accounting of things, thus dematerializing them (cf. Pliushkin, the pack rat in Gogol’s Dead Souls). Theme 1. Hide and seek. A game with gradations of knowledge. The reader does not have all of the information (the protagonist looking at the moving van with the name of the company on it clearly sees more than the reader of the text, but much less than the creator of the text). In the fomentation of this secretive atmosphere there is a verbal catalyst: in other words, the reader must have a sneaking suspicion that there is, if not a solution to the riddle, then at least something important hidden in the phrase itself. We understand by looking at the manuscript how Nabokov achieves this effect — for example, by removing the personal pronoun in the phrase “podumal on” and replacing it with the impersonal construction “podumalos’.” Theme 2. Literature as Process. The overture of The Gift is a sample text — an exemplary manuscript. A Russian formalist technique: concealing the discourse of the manuscript (see Boris Eikhenbaum’s “How Gogol’s Overcoat Is Made”). For Shklovsky and Tynianov, every text becomes automatized after repeated and quick readings, the shades of meaning are lost, and the rough edges and nicks are smoothed over. Nabokov’s The Gift graphically illustrates the theme of literature as process, touching on matters of the overall procedure — the interactions among the literary text, the author’s consciousness, the reader’s reception, and reality. Methods. some day . . . A good, thick old-fashioned thing. The style has changed in this sentence as compared to the previous six. The forced stylistics that have — 361 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- been building up become particularly clear here in order to create the impression of something old-fashioned; there are many archaisms concentrated in the fi rst paragraph (arshin — an old Russian unit of measurement translated in the English phrase “yard-high,” krasnovyinye molodtsy [red-necked husky fellows], with its folk overtones as outlined above, the word pud [another archaic unit of measurement, a weight equivalent to 16 kg] that appears in the working draft, and so on). (8). he himself had only moved in today [HE HIMSELF HAD JUST MOVED HERE FROM A BOARDING HOUSE THREE BLOCKS AWAY], and now, for the # rst time, in the still unacc ustomed state of local resident [DWELLER], he had run out to buy a few things. Plot point. At the beginning of any epic plot, the hero leaves his home. This process is so banal that it almost does not register in the reader’s consciousness. Nabokov (as instructed by the textbook!) focuses our attention on the ur-phenomenon of the narrative — on the starting point when the hero departs from his dwelling. Commentary. himself. The text is also old-fashioned in that each new sentence leads to a question that is then answered by the following one (which is indeed one of the features of antique narrative style). Here we ask: “And who is this ‘he himself’?” The answer from VN (or the Almighty Author), is “he” (in the Russian, the word “he” — on — does not fi rst appear until the next sentence and is preceded by the word sam — himself). First of all, we already know that the protagonist is a man. Second, we know that he has just arrived. Third, in the Russian we are told that he left without any outer layers of clothing (though the word — nalegke — can also mean that he had nothing with him to carry). The English translation, unlike the original, hints at the protagonist being out of something (run out). In the manuscript Nabokov marks out the phrase “three blocks” (tri kvartala), most likely in order to avoid overburdening the text with more numbers (a number expressing volume, “quarter,” is present even in the Russian word kvartal, block). for the # rst time. This is the fi rst use in the text of the word “fi rst,” marking the consecrated beginning of the text. In Eugene Onegin, which Nabokov saw as akin to The Gift both in terms of structure and narrative style, the word “beginning” (nachalo) does not appear until Chapter V. In The Gift, we have a beginning, but an unusual one. The ambiguity and dualism of beginnings and ends (at fi rst there — 362 — ---------------------------------------------------------------- Close Reading ---------------------------------------------------------------- is an ending, and then there is not) will recur many times in the text, because this is a novel about perpetual creation, about making something out of the abyss of chaos (the idea of constancy is contained directly in the patronymic of the main character: Konstantinovich). in the still unacc ustomed state . . . For now the protagonist does not yet have a station in life (the word translated as “state” is the Russian chin — one’s rank or status) — possibly even nalegke (see comments above on “himself”). The usage of the word chin here is not entirely correct from a linguistic standpoint, but it is necessary to introduce the theme of rank and hierarchy. resident. Both the term and the event here may be associated by Nabokov with the corresponding entry in Dahl’s Russian dictionary for the verb obitat’ (to dwell, reside), which is the root of the Russian noun obitatel’, translated here as “resident.” Dahl considers the debatable etymological root of this verb to be the Latin vita — to linger, to live (of an inhabitant), to settle in a place (cf. the epigraph from Smirnovski). As examples of usage, Dahl cites “Lord, who dwelleth in thy house” (Psalms) and “The Albazinians, descendents of Russians, live in China to this day.” The origin of the “thickset woman” is not so much Oriental as literary (cf. Pushkin’s “The residents (obitateli) of Goriukhino were for the most part of average height”). had run out. The adverb nalegke, meaning “lightly dressed” or “with nothing to carry,” follows this verb in the Russian and is not translated in the English. A properly structured wording here with the verb vybezhal (“ran out”) would require answering the two questions “from where?” and “to where?” The word nalegke, beginning as it does with the syllable na (a preposition meaning on, into or at), purports to answer this question — this is how poetic diction is constructed (in Mandelstam, for example). The word that Nabokov had chosen initially — zhilets (“dweller”), judging by the manuscript, was unsatisfactory because the author did not want that sound repetition of zh; the repetition of this sound in zhilets and vybezhal would have obscured the effect created with nalegke. Nabokov uses all of the techniques in the author’s arsenal — fi rst pulling the reader in the direction of a certain euphony, then destroying any harmony that was about to develop. The horizon of the reader’s expectations is fi lled with all the right valences for the appearance of a certain word in this context; but instead of the expected word, a different word appears that resembles the expectation in only one distant way — phonetically. In this case, the reader expects the phrase vybezhal na ulitsu (“had run outside” or “into the street”) and instead gets vybezhal nalegke (“had run out lightly dressed”). to buy. The semantic emphasis is here at the end of the phrase in the words “to buy” (kupit’; in Russian it is the last word of the sentence). By the time we reach the end of the sentence, the stylistic register has sunk: we expect a word — 363 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five. COMMENTARY --------------------------------------------------- like “procure,” but we are given the more colloquial “buy a few things” (koe- chego kupit’). We have already encountered the “buying-and-selling” theme in the text (service-related things have included the name of the company on the moving van, the furniture, and the movers, with their meat-market associations). To understand how “weighty” this theme is, we must return to the word obvesit’ (translated as “short-change,” more literally something like to “short-weight,” i.e. to give a customer less weight than they are charged for). The protagonists are watching to make sure that they will be “weighed up” to the right amount. Theme 1 . Creation of the world/text. The theme of the creation is introduced to the reader’s consciousness by literally sticking it into the beginning of the novel (“to start a thing” — all novels begin some place at some time!). Theme 2. The quest. In creating his rules, the hero — by defi nition a demigod — also does not simply leave home for no reason. The traditional Russian fairy tale opening, zhili-byli (“there lived-there were”) is exploded by the need to go outside. Humankind has not thought up any other narrative plot. In the byliny (Russian folk epics), the hero is obligated to get up from the traditional resting place, the stove, and abandon his native locale, because the death of someone close to him serves as an impulse for him to leave his home (Ershov’s The Humpbacked Horse; Puss in Boots; Ivan the Fool). What is emphasized in this case is usually a set interval of time and a dwelling place (which might be reduced to a stove); but if the family is complete, then the hero has no justifi cation for leaving home (there are various types of incompleteness: for example, the Russian tale of the old couple and their speckled hen simply involves a problem of coloratura). Propp divides the world of the folk tale into two areas: the home and the forest. Everything that is outside the home is forest (which can be disguised, as in the case of cultured forests: cities with vertical spires) (Propp 42). We still do not know Godunov-Cherdyntsev’s motivation for leaving the house, but the function of this device is clear. Motif: Absence, shortage. Without fail, the classical hero has some sort of shortcoming, which he attempts to make up for over the course of the narrative. In a folk tale, the hero is presented with a condition that he is forbidden to violate. The hero does not adhere to this condition (a dual plot cycle: [1] prohibition and [2] violation of the prohibition), at which point magical helpers appear. Several times in the novel we glimpse the ghost of a fairy tale (upon returning home — 364 — ---------------------------------------------------------------- Close Reading ---------------------------------------------------------------- from the Chernyshevskis’ in the fi rst chapter, in the square the character passes by “the public toilet, reminiscent of Baba Yaga’s gingerbread cottage” [G53]). Godunov-Cherdyntsev’s position is an everyday shortage processed into literary forms from the travelogue genre to biography and saint’s life (Sadko, a hero of the byliny, goes out to fi nd a bride because he is missing something). The deep mythological layer of the novel reveals the absence of the father. We see here the old motif, common throughout European literature, of the absence of a physical father and of his spiritual substitute (from the Christian story of Jesus’ reproach to the Father for forsaking him at that moment, all the way up to Raskolnikov). Methods. Before this we have already been presented with all of the dramatis personae in the fi rst scene of the novel. Now we have a localization of the action in cultural space, but we still do not know the social status of the main character. Context. When did the move take place? The actual positioning in time (April fi rst, before 4:00 pm) carries the reader of The Gift to the beginning of the novel’s plot; cf. the shot of the room in the prologue to Speak, Memory (19-20) before the hero appears in this world. Both aesthetically and philosophically, this is the most interesting moment (it is always fascinating to be in a place where we are not, but especially to be transported to the eve of our own birth). The fl ashback is the fi rst tour de force of this type in the novel; there will be many more to come in various places. The temporal shift is characteristic of Russian culture, in which it is customary to experience nostalgia for the epoch of one’s fathers and older brothers. Nabokov is making use of one of the most ancient plots in world literature: a young man awaiting his father — a soldier, traveler, an accomplished man. This is the fi eld of meaning that comes about as the result of the main character running out without his coat on to buy something.

Orientation to the locale. Godunov-Cherdyntsev establishes a connection between his new lodgings and the surrounding topography. Commentary. street. The word street, concealed in the end of the preceding text, begins the ninth sentence (in the Russian, the syntax is ulitsu on znal). The artifi cial delay of this word (or name) to the beginning of a new syntactic construction is needed to reveal its second meaning, which is veiled by a sound pattern: ulitsa (street) = Uliss (Ulysses). The subject of Telemachus and Odysseus is key to the problems raised in The Gift: the hero waits for his father, searches for him, and does not recognize him. Nabokov read the epic in Vassily Zhukovsky’s translation from the ancient Greek (“If you should hear your father lives yet, that homeward he will return . . . ”). Typologically, The Gift has much similarity to Joyce’s novel, which Nabokov had been seriously planning to translate into Russian in the mid- 1930s (the correspondence between Nabokov and Joyce about this is preserved in the National Library of Ireland in Dublin). he knew. Repetition, stumbling over the word, rapid speech: STREET . . . this STREET; he knew, as he KNEW. One can imagine a valid phrase without this twofold doubling. But the repeated verb, generally speaking, is one of the main words in the narrator’s and reader’s life. district . . . in the form of a projection. There was a square at the beginning, and then the theme of the circle (the Russian word for district, okrug, is derived from the word krug, meaning ‘circle’). It is telling that Nabokov crossed out the word “area” [Russ. raion] in the manuscript: in the etymological semantics of his vocabulary, this unsuccessful synonym does not resonate with its direct context, in which an oxymoronic geometry (squaring the circle) accumulates. Theme. Creative work. Writing (or composition) is in fact a form of cognition/knowledge. Nabokov’s novel is about an initiation into a world of imagination, about approaching and then attaching oneself to higher levels of knowledge. Methods. The tautological nature of discourse, stuttering in the text. The text of The Gift is poetic, and everything in it is important — process, duration, the length of our experience of phrases and words. Nabokov takes into account a gap or — 366 — ---------------------------------------------------------------- Close Reading ---------------------------------------------------------------- discrepancy of meaning between incomprehension of the fi rst reading and the pleasure from understanding upon a repeated reading. Subtext. street turned. Throughout the phrase is, as it were, a picture of a revolving phonograph record. The comparison in Nabokov’s sentence to a gramophone record requires further explanation — “turning and stopping”; we should recall that old records turned for a very short time. In the subtext, more than anything else, is the folkloric “Where is this street, where is this house?/Where the young lady, the one that I love?” from the song “The blue sphere turns and spins . . . ” (a pre revolutionary text, revived in the 1934 Soviet fi lm, “Maxim’s Youth”). — 367 — ---------------------------------------------------- Chapter Five.
