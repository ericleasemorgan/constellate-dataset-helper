Paul de Man once called the advent of literary theory a “paper tiger” for its perceived threat to traditional critical methods. His description pokes at broader quirks in the metaphor: “If a cat is called a tiger it can easily be dismissed as a paper tiger; the question remains however why one was so scared of the cat in the first place. The same tactic works in reverse: calling the cat a mouse and then deriding it for its pretense to be mighty. Rather than being drawn into this polemical whirlpool, it might be better to try to call the cat a cat” (The Resistance to Theory [Minneapolis: Uni- versity of Minnesota Press, 1986], 5).

Sedg- wick first presented a paper on paranoid reading in 1995 (see Ellis Hanson, “The Future’s Eve: Reparative Reading after Sedgwick,” South Atlantic Quarterly 110 [2011]: 105). 5. For the Kleinian subject (versus the Freudian subject), Sedgwick notes that “omnipotence is a fear at least as much as it is a wish” (“Melanie Klein and the Differ- ence Affect Makes,” South Atlantic Quarterly 106 [2007]: 631).

Brian Leiter (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 74– 105. 8. Sedgwick elaborated: “To call paranoia a strong theory is, then, at the same time to congratulate it as a big achievement (it’s a strong theory rather as, for Harold Bloom, Milton is a strong poet) but also to classify it. It is one kind of affect theory among other possible kinds, and by [Silvan] Tomkins’s account, a number of inter- related affect theories of different kinds and strengths are likely to constitute the mental life of any individual. Most pointedly, the contrast of strong theory in Tomkins is with weak theory, and the contrast is not in every respect to the advantage of the strong kind. The reach and reductiveness of strong theory— that is, its conceptual economy and elegance— involve both assets and deficits. What characterizes strong theory in Tomkins is not, after all, how well it avoids negative affect or finds positive affect, but the size and topology of the domain that it organizes” (“Paranoid Read- ing,” 134). 9.

In an article about the underrepresenta- tion of women composers in the music history curriculum, Rosemary Killam pointed out that “those who know both me and my writings know that when I write or speak in anger, I use a tone in which I am explicit about such anger” (“Response to Professor Notes to Pages 6–7 • 107 Morse’s Open Letter,” Music Theory Online 3 [1997], http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/ mto.97.3.4/mto.97.3.4.killam.html, par. 2); cf.

On scholars’ social responsibilities, Elaine Scarry writes: “The main work of the humanities is to ensure that books are placed in the hands of each incoming wave of students and carried back out to sea. Probably, though, teachers and readers need to do more. We should give more attention to making clear the lines of responsibil- ity to real- world injuries and the call to that work that is embedded in the three key features of literature [its invitation to empathy, its reliance on deliberate thought, and its beauty]” (“Poetry, Injury, and the Ethics of Reading,” in The Humanities and Public Life, ed.

Granted, claims about aboutness can sound inherently political, circumscrib- ing permissible versus impermissible (or relevant versus irrelevant) queries. Asking what something is (really) about might sometimes launch an evasive and (counterin- tuitively) counterproductive enterprise. See Stephen Yablo, Aboutness (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2014), 7– 9. 19. It is no coincidence that recent debates about “trigger warnings” have arisen concomitantly with expanding dialogues about sexual assault on campus.

I include here three excerpts from the American Musicological Society’s “Guidelines for Ethical Conduct” as they appear in 2016 (last updated in October 1997 upon formal adoption by the board of directors). These excerpts are among the most relevant ones pertaining to AMS members’ social and pedagogical duties. First, in the preamble: “Since the behavior of musicologists, in whatever professional capacities they serve, affects the well-b eing and reputation of the entire profession, members of the Society are expected to uphold these principles not only in their scholarly work but also in all their professional capacities” (American Musicological Soci- ety 2015 Directory [2015], http://www.ams-net.org/administration/ethics.php, xxx- 108 • Notes to Pages 7–9 iv). Second, in a section on harassment: “Members of the AMS are therefore obliged not to abuse the power with which they are entrusted, but rather to create profes- sional settings that foster respect for the rights of others. Furthermore, members of the AMS should neither condone harassment in any form nor disregard complaints of harassment or inequitable treatment from any person or group involved with the AMS and its activities” (xl). And third, in a section on teaching responsibilities: “In their roles as teachers, AMS members should maintain a strictly professional relation- ship with students while in a position of power over them, judging each student on merit alone. They should promote an atmosphere of respect for the personal differ- ence and dignity of each student, and protect students’ rights to confidentiality and privacy. The conditions for free exchange of ideas can be created only when such rights are observed” (xli). 23.

Wu continues: “My biggest concern as I face down another 25 years or so in this profession is not that I will become disaffected or stalled in my research. It’s whether or not I can convince my fellow tenured colleagues to agree that we not pull the ladder up behind us and abandon the others in the inter- est of careerist gain. I don’t find tenure depressing. I find it sobering. We need to use that sobriety to take collective responsibility for making the academy more livable for everyone.” 24.

A professor (writing under a pseudonym) describes the challenges of care- work in her encounters with students and colleagues who regularly come to her with dilemmas: “Just listening is the best you can do. With student mental- health issues on the rise and faculty stress running high, there is more and more care- work to do. While it would be nice if colleges and universities could find a way to recognize this as service work, the personal, confidential nature of these conversations makes that unlikely” (Myra Green, “Thanks for Listening,” Chronicle of Higher Education [19 Octo- ber, 2015], http://chronicle.com/article/Thanks-for-Listening/233825). 47.

Carol Hess remarks: “How did musicology, so broadly defined in 1939, change to the point that we now feel compelled to distinguish ‘public musicology’ from . . . what? Some other kind of musicology? Program notes, pre- concert talks, writing arti- cles and blogs for lay audiences may well be the forms of public musicology most familiar to us. But curating, government work, archival work, and oral history are other possibilities that greet those trained in our discipline. Do we need a theoreti- cal underpinning to pursue these interests? Have our activities become constricted over the years— frozen in the academy, as it were— or have they expanded, even in these challenging economic times?” (“Public Musicology . . . 1939,” Musicology Now [15 November 2013], http://musicologynow.ams-net.org/2013/11/public-musicol- ogy-1939.html).

The excerpt in French: “Être à l’écoute, c’est donc entrer dans la tension et dans le guet d’un rapport à soi: non pas, il faut le souligner, un rap- port à ‘moi’ (sujet supposé donné) et pas non plus au ‘soi’ de l’autre (le parleur, le musicien, lui aussi supposé donné avec sa subjectivité), mais le rapport en soi, si je peux dire, tel qu’il forme un ‘soi’ ou un ‘à soi’ en général et si quelque chose de tel arrive jamais au terme de sa formation” (Jean- Luc Nancy, À l’écoute [Paris: Galilée, 2002], 30). 23. Nancy, Listening, 17. The original French: “Il faudrait ici s’arrêter longue- ment sur le rythme: il n’est pas autre chose que le temps du temps, l’ébranlement du temps lui- même dans la frappe d’un présent qui le présente en le disjoignant de lui- même. . . . Ainsi, le rythme disjoint la succession de la linéarité de la séquence ou de la durée: il plie le temps pour le donner au temps lui- même, et c’est de cette façon qu’il plie et déplie un ‘soi’” (Nancy, À l’écoute, 37– 38).

Several months after reading Listening by Nancy, I came across Roger Mathew Grant’s review of this book in the Journal of the American Musicological Society 62 (2009): 748– 52. The review, which effectively parses the original French text and its English translation, illumi- nates many of Nancy’s complex claims.

Sokal, Intellectual Impostures: Postmodern Philosophers’ Abuse of Science (London: Profile Books, 1998). Postcolonial scholar Homi Bhabha has pushed back against criticisms of humanists’ difficult language: “There is a damaging and self-d efeating assumption that theory is necessarily the elite language of the socially and culturally privileged” (The Location of Culture [New York: Routledge, 1994], 28). Disciplinary envy, moreover, can cut both ways, seeing as how mathematicians and scientists often seek beauty and aesthetic value in their fields of inquiry. See, for example, Mario Livio’s The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, the World’s Most Astonishing Number (New York: Broadway Books, 2002) and Is God a Mathematician? (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2009). 26. For an analysis of this Hans Christian Andersen tale, see Hollis Robbins, “The Emperor’s New Critique,” New Literary History 34 (2003): 659– 75. 27.

Historical discourses about people’s varying pain thresholds have often sprung out of racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory and dehumanizing perspectives. Claims about the higher pain thresholds of people of African origins, for example, fed apologias for chattel slavery.

On how gamers and academics face comparable accusations of losing touch with reality, see William Cheng, Sound Play: Video Games and the Musical Imagination (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), 15– 16. Gamers are often asked why they spend so much time in virtual worlds, roaming fantastical lands and seeking castles in the sky. And at times, scholars—e specially those in the arts and humanities—l ikewise get called out for holing up in ivory towers, debating and discoursing about a subject rather than really doing something about it (say, via social intervention, political activ- ism, or obvious material contribution). In short, both groups are routinely charged with playing at something almost real, but not quite. 13.

Jonathan Pieslak describes these wildly different takes on Korsyn’s book: “Korsyn speaks of the ‘crisis’ of discourse in musical scholarship, and, indeed, the disagree- ments about the ‘crisis’ and the contrasting ways scholars have read the book seem to affirm its existence. . . . If these varied reactions do not, themselves, indicate the ‘crisis’ Korsyn is talking about, it is at least, for me, confusing” (“Review of Decentering Music,” Music Theory Online 14 [2008]: par. 10). 29.

Felicia Miyakawa has described her decision to leave a tenured position in musicology as follows: “On the first day of the conference [on public musicology], I spoke about how/why I left academia. For the rest of the day and into the next, numerous people cornered me to tell me how brave I am. This is a comment I’ve been getting all too frequently since I quit my job. And it invariably comes from current academics who cop to sharing many of my experiences. I’ll admit I feel just a little worse each time I am called ‘brave,’ because this comment drives home to me just how many people are unhappy or frustrated in their academic positions but have little power to change their situation. I am ‘brave’ because I escaped, because I found a way out, because I was willing to take a big risk and walk away from a broken system. It saddens me to know that so many of my peers are so frustrated. Or maybe there’s a different way to interpret being brave. Let’s talk about it” (“Going Rogue: On Leaving the Academy and Taking Risks” [1 February 2015], http://fmmiyakawa. com/2015/02/01/on-being-brave-publicmusicology). 40.

Sedgwick, “Paranoid Reading,” 125– 26. In a later essay, Sedgwick elaborated on the relationship between paranoia and queer theory: “I overlooked the crudest, most contingent, and probably also most important reason why paranoia seems so built into queer theory as such. To quite get that, I think one has to have experienced gay life in the 1980s and early ’90s, when queer theory was still a tentative, emergent itinerary. That was also the moment when AIDS was a new and nearly untreatable disease— bringing a sudden, worse than Euripidean horror into the lives of urban gay men and their friends. It was not an uncommon experience then to be in a room of vibrant young people, conscious that within a year or two, all but a few of them would have sickened and died” (“Melanie Klein,” 638). 5.

Brett, “Musicality,” 17. On the “deviant” connotations of musicality, Brett has also remarked that “it is surely no coincidence that among the many code words and phrases for a homosexual man before Stonewall (and even since), ‘musical’ (as in, ‘Is he “musical” do you think?’) ranked with others such as ‘friend of Dorothy’ as safe insider euphemisms” (11). 34. In addition to musical indicators, there are (mundane) sonic signifiers of queerness, whether it’s the “gay lisp” or other stereotyped variables of tone, pitch, range, lexicon, and phraseology.

One area where I feel How to Be Gay falters, irrespective of music, is its strategic yet impolitic neglect of queer categories and genres outside a predominantly privi- leged rubric of white, male, cis, middle-c lass, able- bodied, domiciled, youthful gays. As Halperin, at the AMS session, doubled down on the desirable aspects of embracing legible gayness, Stephan Pennington rose from the audience to voice the indispens- able caveat that for many people—e specially those who are, for example, trans, home- less, of color—m arkers of queerness can drastically heighten one’s susceptibility to violence and injustice. Not everyone, in other words, has the security or wherewithal to benefit from knowing what it means (or takes) to be straightforwardly gay in the first place.

McClary recounts: “I had several occasions to stand in a long line in the wom- en’s room, where I was privy to unrelieved carping about this woman who was ‘deter- mined to drag our Schubert through the mud.’ [Maynard] Solomon’s article had been circulated in advance, and some of those who spoke during the course of the day deemed it appropriate to take gratuitous swipes at him (‘a pornographer’), with the obvious approval of the crowd” (“Constructions of Subjectivity,” 206). See also Elaine Barkin, “either/or,” Perspectives of New Music 30 (1992): 206– 33. 48. Much ink has been spilled over how McClary’s studies of music and sexuality have been mischaracterized, misunderstood, and misappropriated. Suzanne Cusick calls McClary “one of the most misquoted musicologists in history” (“Gender, Musi- Notes to Pages 68–72 • 125 cology, and Feminism,” in Cook and Everist, Rethinking Music, 488 n. 30); see also Robert Fink, “Beethoven Antihero: Sex, Violence, and the Aesthetics of Failure, or Listening to the Ninth Symphony as Postmodern Sublime,” in Dell’Antonio, Beyond Structural Listening?, 109– 53. McClary has reflected on the wild reception of Feminine Endings, noting that “no one (least of all this author) could have anticipated that a drab- looking little book from the University of Minnesota Press would be cause for a twenty- year reflection” (“Feminine Endings at Twenty,” TRANS: Revista Transcultural de Música 15 [2011], http://www.sibetrans.com/trans/public/docs/trans_15_02_ McClary.pdf). 49.

Bruno Latour puts it this way: “As soon as naïve believ- ers are thus inflated by some belief in their own importance, in their own projective capacity, you strike them by a second uppercut and humiliate them again, this time by showing that, whatever they think, their behavior is entirely determined by the action of powerful causalities coming from objective reality they don’t see, but that you, yes you, the never sleeping critic, alone can see. Isn’t this fabulous? Isn’t it really worth going to graduate school to study critique?” (“Critique,” 239). 51. In seminal sociological projects, Erving Goffman proposed that people’s everyday behaviors are structured by performative efforts to avoid the embarrassment of selves and others (see “Embarrassment and Social Organization,” American Journal of Sociology 62 [1956]: 264– 71; and The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life [Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1959]).

It is not a phenomenon of the current admin- istration or the current wars; it is not news. The only news is that in the last few years we have become increasingly aware of it; that, and perhaps the unnerving fact that our awareness of this practice has provoked no public outcry” (3– 4).

On music torture and sexual humiliation, Cusick explains: “The belief that music could torture emerges, in the blogosphere, among people who feel themselves to be ‘tortured’ by certain musics— rap music, disco, sentimental ballads, the music of Yoko Ono. Additionally, the idea that music could torture seems linked both to homophobia and to heterosexual fantasy; in fact, the most lively repertoire discus- sions propose as torturous popular musics easily associated with either homosexual- ity or the effeminacy perceived to come from being too emotionally engaged with women. These folk seem readily to imagine themselves moving from tortured to torturer, and imagine music torturing by either a racial/cultural affront or, more often, by feminizing and/or queerifying Muslim men: either way, detainees would be emasculated (and the bloggers’ masculinity, presumably, strengthened)” (“Music as Torture”). 9. The effects of musical bombardment go beyond mere facts of physical and psychic assault. Cusick describes how one particular detainee’s attempts to “resist pain with thought” were acoustically “jammed” by continuous, subjectivity- invading music (“Towards an Acoustemology of Detention in the ‘Global War on Terror,’” in Music, Sound and Space: Transformations of Public and Private Experience, ed.

Elaine Scarry remarks that “the human capacity to injure other people is very great precisely because our capacity to imagine other people is very small” (“The Dif- ficulty of Imagining Other Persons,” in Human Rights in Political Transitions: Gettysburg to Bosnia, ed. Carla Hesse and Robert Post [New York: Zone Books, 1999], 285). 14. Exercises in selective imagination underscore the polemics of the infamous ticking time- bomb scenario (the hypothetical question of whether one would or should torture a terrorist who is believed to know the location of a presumed bomb about to go off in a city). Concerning moral and legal responsibility, Elaine Scarry notes: “It is a peculiar characteristic of such hypothetical arguments on behalf of tor- ture that the arguer can always ‘imagine’ someone large-s pirited enough to overcome (on behalf of a city’s population) his aversion to torture, but not so large-s pirited that he or she can also accept his or her own legal culpability and punishment” (“Five Errors in the Reasoning of Alan Dershowitz,” in Levinson, Torture, 282); cf.

In an odd admission, this is what the player- character Trevor says to the detain- ee following the torture sequence: “The media and the government would have us believe that torture is some necessary thing. We need it to get information, to assert ourselves. Did we get any information out of you? Exactly. Torture’s for the tortur- er . . . or for the guy giving orders to the torturer. You torture for the good times—w e should all admit that. It’s useless as a means of getting information” (Rockstar Games, Grand Theft Auto V). 20.

Pieslak, Sound Targets, 172. “If ‘I Love You’ were played repeatedly for an hour,” suggests Pieslak, “the complete melody would be heard 120 times and the 128 • Notes to Pages 82–87 main melodic motive would be heard 360 times. Adding to the repetition, the singing style of the children, presumably Barney’s target audience of preschoolers or young children, seems unnaturally uniform and calm. It is hard to imagine a group of four- to six- year- olds singing with such precision, clarity, and restraint, and for me, the vocal performance is unnervingly artificial. The repetitive timbres of music intended for children make for a powerful source of antagonism” (171). Assuming a basic com- prehension of English, moreover, a detainee’s idea of what love is might break down from being forced to listen to sing- songy reiterations of “I love you” at high volumes and for hours on end. Semantics and affects crash together, twisting one’s feelings and understandings of love even after the torture stops. 24.

As Cusick writes: “Every amplified sound in these camps, and therefore every bit of music, is the United States’ transformation of the energy in Middle Eastern oil into violent, violating sonic energy aimed directly at the people whose land yielded that oil— people who are as powerless to resist our thirst for their lands’ resources as they are to resist the use of those transformed resources against them” (“You Are in a Place,” 18).

One person (username andrewkilroy5) on the simulation’s website wrote: “Should I laugh at this or should I be horrified by it? I am Autistic and I think this is terrible stereotyping.” To which creator Taylan Kay responded: “Hi Andrew. I’m very sorry that you found this horrifying. I understand where you are coming from and wish that we could have done a better job at describing your experience with autism. The reality of the situation though is that it is not possible to make this a 100% accurate simulation for everyone with autism, as there is a wide variation in how each person experiences hypersensitivity. Chances are someone else on the ASD would find your description of it incomplete as well. I will concede that the ‘Sim’ in Auti- Sim might have caused a different expectation, and it is a valid criticism. Going forward, we should consider doing a better job of communicating the goal of our project, which is to raise awareness of and empathy for hypersensitivity” (andrewkilroy5 and Taylan Kay, “Comments: Page 9,” Game Jolt [2 March 2013], http://gamejolt.com/ games/auti-sim/12761?comment_page=9). 48.
