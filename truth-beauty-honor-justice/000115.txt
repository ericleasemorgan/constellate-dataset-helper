Conclusion: The Romanticization of Criminals and the Defense against Despair The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation . —Henry David Thoreau We tell ourselves stories in order to live. —Joan Didion In the essay s that form th e core o f this book, I have explored thre e central paradoxe s o f crimina l justice : belove d prisons , romanti c outlaws, an d a metaphor tha t render s criminal s a s attractiv e filth. In thi s final chapter , I wil l discus s theme s presen t i n al l thre e essays, themes tha t we—like traveler s looking back over the coun - try we have crossed—are onl y now in a position t o survey . A pervasiv e theme , perhap s th e mos t genera l one , i s tha t o f complexity: the highly differentiated an d paradoxica l nature o f ou r feelings abou t crim e an d punishment . Mor e specifically , I hav e tried t o sho w tha t th e crimina l justic e system , fa r from bein g a simple, straightforwar d expressio n o f ou r antipath y fo r crim e an d criminals, i s in fac t deepl y psychologicall y roote d an d base d upo n conflicting feeling s o f attraction an d repulsion , lov e and hatred . I n the American crimina l justice system a t the presen t time , on e sid e of thi s ambivalenc e i s o n th e rise . Th e increase d us e o f capita l punishment, th e rag e o f prison construction , an d suc h policie s a s "Three Strike s an d You'r e Out"—al l expres s a conscious fea r an d hatred o f criminal s an d a desire t o restrai n lawbreaker s an d wrea k vengeance upo n them . Bu t thi s boo k ha s attempte d t o highligh t the dialectica l undersid e o f ou r ambivalence : th e romanti c allur e of both criminal s and thei r prison homes . What i s th e origi n o f thi s strang e attractio n t o th e ver y peopl e 188 Conclusion 189 and place s we would expec t t o abhor ? O n on e level , th e intricate , many-faceted characte r o f ou r feeling s towar d criminal s stem s from ou r inabilit y t o apprehen d realit y directly . As Juliet Mitchel l has written , w e "acquire " reality , an d d o s o i n a proces s heavil y mediated b y ou r early-lif e experience s an d unconsciou s menta l processes.1 Tha t ou r feeling s towar d criminal s mus t b e complex i s inevitable o n thi s account , thoug h no t o n thi s accoun t alone . For beside s th e mediatin g proces s throug h whic h "events " be - come "experience, " ther e i s a n additiona l reaso n wh y th e law , crime, an d punishmen t ten d t o evok e complicate d responses . A s we hav e seen , th e law , whic h enjoy s authorit y ove r th e citizen , represents th e parent , wh o enjoy s authorit y ove r th e child . Thus , the la w inherit s powerfu l feeling s o f lov e an d hatre d tha t wer e directed towar d th e paren t i n earl y life . More particularly , th e la w stands fo r bot h fathe r an d mother . Insofa r a s i t manifest s itsel f a s an infallibl e judg e o r a n agen t o f punishment , th e la w resonate s with th e archetypa l father . Whe n i t finds expressio n a s a prison , on the othe r hand , the law evokes the archetypa l mother , th e grea t container who nurture s an d holds . If th e la w i s th e parent , the n th e crimina l i s th e child . Mor e exactly, th e crimina l i s th e perpetual chil d tha t w e all , a t times , yearn t o be . I t seem s strang e a t first tha t criminals , wh o ar e thought o f a s guilty , shoul d b e equate d wit h children , wh o ar e imagined a s the mos t innocent o f beings. Yet we have seen numer - ous example s o f imprisone d lawbreaker s wh o conceiv e o f them - selves a s dependen t childre n envelope d i n a protectiv e womb . Moreover, the y experienc e thi s wom b a s timeless , evokin g th e child's happy obliviousnes s t o th e passage o f the years . From th e perspectiv e o f the noncriminal , a s well, the criminals ' allure flows partl y from thei r childlik e qualities—thei r "charm - ing" unscrupulousness , thei r refusa l t o accep t responsibility , an d their embodimen t o f freedom . Criminal s are , o f course , free i n their refusa l t o abid e b y the law s tha t othe r peopl e obey , wherea s children symboliz e freedom i n their incarnation o f limitless poten - tial. As Friedrich Schille r ha s written, i t i s this qualit y o f the chil d that fascinate s adults : 190 Conclusion We are moved in the presence of childhood, but it is not because from the height of our strength and of our perfection we drop a look of pity on it; it is, on the contrary, because from the depths of our impotence . . . we raise our eyes to the child's determinable- ness and pure innocence.... In the child all is disposition and des- tination; in us all is in the state of a completed, finished thing, and the completion always remains infinitely below the destination.. . . This is the reason why . .. th e child will always be a sacred thing."2 As this passage suggests , we romanticize children , endowin g the m with a greatness we no longe r possess , an d viewing them a s exoti c creatures who "comet h from afar. " Similar t o th e childre n wit h who m the y ar e linked , criminal s likewise ar e viewed a s glamorou s an d romanti c figures. No t onl y are they associate d wit h th e exoti c (a s we saw , for instance , i n The Great Gatsby and Kidnapped), bu t als o the y ar e connecte d wit h a view o f lif e a s intens e an d exalted , wit h a romanti c "denia l o f the present " an d a "rejectio n o f th e world-as-it-is." 3 Thi s them e pervades th e priso n memoir s w e examine d i n "Cradle d o n th e Sea." Thus, Nerzhin , th e inmat e i n The First Circle, expressed hi s fear o f wallowing in daily living with th e Russian proverb : "It' s no t the se a tha t drown s you ; it' s th e puddle. " Pena l confinement , Nerzhin reflected , wa s th e sea , th e plac e wher e h e ha d avoide d immersion i n th e mundan e an d trivial , where h e ha d bee n abl e t o learn "abou t peopl e an d event s abou t whic h h e coul d lear n no - where els e o n earth. " In anothe r romanti c appraisa l o f penal con - finement, Eugeni a Ginsbur g declared: "There ar e no more ferven t friendships tha n thos e made in prison. " Just a s these prisoners inves t their prison s with a romantic aura , so als o societ y endow s criminal s wit h a passion an d intensit y tha t enhance life' s meaning. One thinks , for instance , o f Martin Dysart , the psychiatris t i n Equus wh o poignantl y expresse d hi s env y o f Alan Strang , th e bo y wh o ha d stabbe d horses , puttin g ou t thei r eyes. Whil e recognizin g tha t th e bo y ha d bee n dangerous , an d might b e again , Dysar t coul d no t hel p bu t contras t hi s ow n "shrunken," "pallid, " and "provincial " life with the passionate exis - tence tha t Alan' s crim e reflected . I n anothe r example , Marlow , i n Conclusion 191 Heart of Darkness, admire d th e crimina l Kurtz , notwithstandin g that th e ma n ha d committe d "abominabl e terrors, " for Kurt z a t least ha d a vision, i n contras t t o th e ordinar y citizen s o f Brussel s with thei r "insignifican t an d sill y dreams. " If criminals , wh o def y th e law , ar e "romance-empurpled," 4 larger-than-life figures, i t follow s tha t lawyers , who serv e th e law , are r oman c e d figures, prosai c an d dull . I n thi s vein , th e Englis h essayist Charle s Lam b observe d dubiously : "Lawyers , I suppose , were childre n once." 5 Distan t fro m childhood , lawyer s ar e por - trayed a s uncomfortabl e wit h lifelon g yearnings . Fo r example , i n Great Expectations, when Pi p trie s t o tel l hi s guardia n ho w h e ha d always longe d fo r a n education , Jagger s cut s hi m of f wit h th e words: "Neve r min d wha t yo u hav e alway s longe d for , Mr . Pip , . . . kee p to the record . I f you long fo r i t now, that' s enough." 6 Although i n theory th e law is pedantic an d dull , thi s dullnes s i s partly a defense ; i n practice , th e la w i s ofte n drive n b y th e ver y romanticism i t claim s t o despise . Fo r example , i n Par t Thre e o f this boo k w e sa w ho w a fascinatio n wit h criminal s motivate d seemingly straightforwar d policie s o f crimina l justice—policie s emphasizing order , routine , an d segregatio n o f th e "contami - nated" crimina l from th e "uncontaminated " law-abidin g citizen . Nor di d th e romanti c root s o f thes e policie s remai n submerged ; rather the y surface d i n th e lega l institutio n o f banishment , whic h featured th e crimina l a s th e protagonis t o f a n exoti c drama , th e Fall. What i s the functio n o f romanticizing criminal s an d thei r plac e of punishment? Romanticis m serve s to ward of f the various narcis - sistic wound s t o whic h ou r flesh i s heir—th e fea r o f leadin g prosaic, meaningless live s and the pain o f recognizing ou r ultimat e solitude an d ou r morta l condition . A scen e from a work w e hav e examined i n anothe r contex t beautifull y illustrate s th e defensiv e function o f romancin g th e criminal . I refe r t o th e scen e i n The Playboy of the Western World wher e Pegee n Mik e an d th e othe r villagers hav e jus t learned tha t Christ y ha s not , afte r all , killed hi s father. Pegee n speak s scornfull y t o Christy : "And it' s lies you told , letting on you had him slitted , and you nothing a t all. " 192 Conclusion In ceasin g t o b e a patricide , Christ y ha s become , no t a n ordi - nary, decen t citizen , bu t "nothin g a t all. " Pegeen' s languag e re - flects th e narcissisti c premis e tha t withou t greatness , on e i s noth - ing. I n th e dream s o f ou r youth , w e aspir e t o greatness ; w e demand tha t lif e giv e us everything . Bu t a s time goe s on , we mus t relinquish suc h expectations ; i n th e end , i n death , w e fac e th e relinquishment o f everything. 7 Wit h Wordsworth , w e mus t ask : "Where i s it now, the glor y and th e dream?" 8 A s I discussed i n " A Strange Liking, " we neve r completel y accep t thes e losses . Rather , we defen d agains t awarenes s o f our limited , morta l stat e b y imag - ining ourselve s a s "extraordinary " an d "great, " o r b y identifyin g with thos e w e conceiv e o f a s havin g thes e qualities . I n th e con - struction o f suc h defenses , criminals , w e hav e seen , pla y a specia l role. Becaus e the y ignore th e limit s and mora l compunction s tha t bind ordinar y people , they are easily assimilated t o the category o f greatness. And s o Christy , a s a glamorous patricide , investe d th e villagers ' drab live s wit h excitemen t an d meaning . Whe n i t turn s ou t tha t he ha s not , i n fact , kille d hi s father , th e villager s fee l diminishe d by his loss of criminal stature . Reflecting th e collective disappoint - ment, Pegee n Mik e say s ruefully : "An d t o thin k o f th e coaxin g glory we had give n him. " For m y fina l example , I tur n t o th e classi c children' s boo k A Little Princess, b y Frances Hodgson Burnett . Like The Playboy of the Western World, this story shows the defensiv e us e of the crimina l t o participate i n glory and assuag e feelings o f powerlessness. I n addi - tion, i t depict s a variation o n ou r theme : th e noncrimina l who , o n the verg e o f hopelessness , gratefull y embrace s th e statu s o f pris - oner. Near th e beginning o f the book , Sar a Crewe , a pupil a t Miss Minchin's Londo n School , i s banished t o th e garre t an d force d t o work a s a servan t afte r he r fathe r die s penniless . I n th e followin g scene, Sara' s friend Ermengard e visit s Sar a i n he r col d an d cheer - less abode : Ermengarde looked around the attic with a rather fearsome curi - osity. "Sara," she said, "do you think you can bear living here?" Sara looked round also. Conclusion I O 3 "If I pretend it's quite different, I can," she answered. "Or if I pretend it is a place in a story." She spoke slowly. Her imagination was beginning to work for her. It had not worked for her at all since her troubles had come upon her. She had felt as if it had been stunned . "Other people have lived in worse places. Think of the Coun t of Monte Cristo in the dungeons of the Chateau d'If . And think of the people in the Bastille!" "The Bastille," half whispered Ermengarde, watching her and beginning to be fascinated... . A well-known glow came into Sara's eyes. "Yes," she said, hugging her knees. "That will be a good place to pretend about . I am a prisoner in the Bastille. I have been here for years and years; and everybody has forgotten abou t me. Miss Minchin is the jailer—and Becky"—a sudden light adding itself to the glow in her eyes—"Becky is the prisoner in the next cell." She turned to Ermengarde, looking quite like the old Sara. "I shall pretend that," she said, "and it will be a great com- fort."9 Like Sara , like the villagers , we too use criminal s and prison s t o exalt ou r lives , t o comfor t ourselve s i n th e fac e o f ou r finitude , t o defend agains t despair . Thi s paradox , o f course , i s no t th e whol e story; i t is only one stran d o f a mingled yarn , th e silve r lining of a sable cloud .
