MESSAGE 
From the Executive
While I was attending the Melbourne International AIDS Society 
(IAS) conference in July, I must admit that I was surprised at the 
announcement by the Minister of Health on the change in our 
eligibility criteria for antiretrovirals (ARVs). He announced that, 
to be in line with the World Health Organization, all HIV-infected 
individuals with a CD4+ count <500 cells/µl should be started on 
antiretroviral therapy (ART), and that all HIV-infected pregnant 
women should initiate lifelong therapy, namely Option B+. e 
Society congratulates the National Department of Health on 
their willingness to amend South African ARV policy in order to 
treat as many individuals as possible.
In terms of raising the  CD4+ entry level to 500 cells/µl, 
it must be noted that while randomised, clinical trial data 
on the clinical benefit of ART in patients with CD4+ counts 
>350 cells/µl are not yet available, we do recognise that there 
are advantages to having more people on medication. There is 
a clear transmission-prevention benefit in discordant couples 
and there are accumulating data in the community setting.
So, as clinicians, we need to up our counselling game. The task 
of taking lifelong medication is an onerous one. Our current first 
line is not forgiving of missed doses. We, as healthcare workers, 
should have a thorough discussion with patients about the 
potential benefits, uncertainties and side-effects of medication. 
If patients are motivated to stick to their treatment, they should 
be prescribed ART; if they do not yet feel ready, they should 
be given time to work through the issues needed to adhere to 
therapy. Obviously, this would be done with close monitoring of 
their CD4+ counts.
On another note, September 2014 brings our next confe rence.
It promises to be packed with interesting debates, excellent 
plenaries and top-notch speakers. For those of you who are 
attending, enjoy the opportunity to network and connect 
with other HIV clinicians. For 
those of you who cannot make it,
