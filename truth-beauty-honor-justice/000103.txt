Notes Introduction 1. Marie Gottschalk, Mary Katzenstein, Stuart Scheingold, Bill Lyons, Jonathan Simon, David Garland, and Thomas Dumm have all conducted skill- ful and timely research into punishment and its politics. Political scientists have also extensively studied crime and "law and order" political behavior and elec- toral strategies. While these strategies may create support for the penal regime, these studies do not focus on the punishments that occur as a result of them. Disenfranchisement is also a new focus of concern among political scientists in the increasingly tight electoral map. 2. Max Weber, "Politics as a Vocation," in From Max Weber (New York: Taylor and Francis, 1948). 3. Here I have deliberately avoiding using the phrase "the state's subjects" because recent events demonstrate that one does not need to be a citizen or member of a polity to suffer punishment at the hands of its state. 4. My thanks to Daniel Tompkins for pointing this out. 5. Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, trans. Martin Oswald (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1962), 121. 6. G. F. W. Hegel, Philosophy of Right, trans. T.

Others argue that recent changes in victims' rights have reintroduced the element of revenge in the law (Culbert 2001).

James Madison expressed frustration with this fact in Federalist 37: "But no language is so copious as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea, or so correct as not to include many, equivocally denoting different ideas . . . . When the Almighty himself condescends to address mankind in their own language, his meaning, luminous though it must be, is rendered dim and doubtful, by the cloudy medium through which it is communicated." 23.

Peter Neumeyer (1971) examines a book that Kafka wrote was central to his life in 1914, Oskar Weber's Der Zuckerbaron, which recounts the life and adventures of a former German officer in South America. Strangely, the book closes with the officer imagining his own grave and inscription upon it, which is reminiscent of the ending of "In the Penal Colony." Anthony D.

Nahum Glatzer, 407-10 (New York: Schocken, 1971). In this story, a "Northern Euro- pean" traveling in what seems to be Egypt is recruited by a group of Jackals to prove his superior status by killing the Arabs for them. The Jackals seem to rep- resent the settlers; the Arabs the native population; and the traveler once again represents the confused homeland trying to determine who is good and who is bad in an unfamiliar territory. 168 NOTES TO PAGES 35-49 31. On January 26,2006, Joshua Marquis, vice president of the National Dis- trict Attorneys Association, published an editorial in the New York Times calcu- lating a success rate of accurate convictions in the U.s. justice system at 99.973 percent. He comments, "Most industries would like to claim such a record of efficiency. " Chapter 2 1. Friedrich Nietzsche, On the Genealogy of Morals, trans. Walter Kaufman and R. J.

The members met at Benjamin Franklin's house to discuss the science of law, government, and the connection between political institutions and public morality. Members could write papers, submit them to the president and vice president for approval, and then present them for discussion at meetings. Thomas Paine wrote the charter from which the pre- ceding passage is taken. The society is still intact today. Early documents are housed at the American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia. 3.

Jane Mayer examined the philosophical outlook of David Addington, Vice Presi- dent Cheney's Chief of Staff and one of the legal minds behind administration policies. He believes that legality is secondary to executive authority and there- fore all executive actions are beyond question. See Jane Mayer, "The Hidden Power," New Yorker 82, no. 20 (2006): 44-55. 9. The New York Times published an article on March 19, 2006, revealing practices of abuse at Camp Nama, a location near the Baghdad airport where even more egregious acts were committed against detainees. It seems that this list could keep growing, as human rights organizations are interviewing those who have been detained. They claim that there are dozens of places in Iraq- thus far without names-where U.S. soldiers have been abusing, killing, and raping detainees. 10.
