is edition of the Journal, released to coincide with 
the Southern African HIV Clinicians Society’s biannual 
conference, showcases local clinical research in keeping with 
the conference theme, ‘Excelling in Clinical Care’. 
In their forum article, Geffen et al.[1] open the issue with a 
call for two potentially significant adaptations to the ‘one size 
fits all’ policies that characterise many public sector services, to 
deliver antiretroviral therapy across southern Africa. Paediatric 
neurological and psychiatric complications are an area of 
particular complexity in HIV management, and to help primary 
care providers investigate, diagnose and manage children, Nassen 
et al.[2] have produced simple yet comprehensive guidelines.
Two submissions explore the prevention of mother-to-child 
transmission of HIV from very different perspectives. First, 
Pillay et al.[3] investigate the potential role of DC-SIGN and 
related molecules in the vertical transmission of HIV. Shifting 
from molecular methods to health systems perspectives, Ibeto 
et al.[4] explore the patient- and service-level factors that may 
contribute to HIV transmission at a population level. 
Two articles showcase strong examples of local clinical 
research. Working in KwaZulu-Natal, Kudsk-Iversen et al.[5] 
describe the challenges in diagnosing and managing patients 
presenting with diarrhoea in a district hospital, pointing to 
the need for clearer guidelines – a possible future focus of 
the Society. Sogbanmu et al.[6] document the challenges in 
implementing guidelines for the management of cryptococcal 
meningitis in the Eastern Cape. These two articles demonstrate 
the importance of locally appropriate guidelines to support 
clinical care.
I hope that you enjoy this issue of the Journal and the conference. 
For those of you who cannot attend the sessions in Cape Town, we 
will run the best abstracts from the meeting in the December edition.
Happy reading.
