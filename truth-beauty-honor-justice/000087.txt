Charles Peirce coined the term to indicate a belief that some real chance was a feature of the universe. It was tychism that most attracted William James’s interest in Peirce’s early cosmological essays. 3. Ralph Waldo Emerson, The Collected Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson (CW), 6 vols., ed. Alfred R.

The point here is that both Zevon and Garcia, as ironist, poetic, social critics, remind me of Thoreau’s similar role in his hometown of Concord, Massachusetts. 18.

I use the word ‘‘wilderness’’ here as did European–Americans in the nineteenth century. However, what is wilderness for some is ‘‘home’’ for others, and it is important to keep these perspectives in mind. As Bruce Wil- shire suggests, some persons have a ‘‘wilderness self ’’ that allows them to be at home in wild situations (Wild Hunger: The Primal Roots of Modern Addic- tion [Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 1998], pp. 84–85). Nevertheless, the European–American version is useful in establishing the analogy that Bugbee develops. 2. Henry Bugbee chose to do philosophy differently in the 1950s. The Inward Morning was unique and drew significant praise, but was held to be something other than philosophy. After working for several years at Har- vard, Bugbee was let go for the usual reason—he didn’t publish enough in the right places. Nevertheless, W. V. Quine, who worked with Bugbee for a time, recalled that ‘‘Henry is the ultimate exemplar of the examined life.’’ Edward F.

Marcel is here discussing ‘‘belief taken in its full or comprehensive reality’’ and not ‘‘a particular belief.’’ Nev- ertheless, I think his point is effective at least as a description of what I have in mind for our disclosed intuitions and found inheritances. 8. Henry Bugbee, The Inward Morning: A Philosophical Exploration in Journal Form (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1999), p. 36.

Hicks (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1966). Thoreau’s differences with the social reformers, like Emerson’s, resulted directly from his different conception of political action and what constituted ameliorative work. By and large, he saw reformers as unfree—as disciples of one sort or another, or as marketers. 262 Notes to Pages 87–93 6.

Whereas the vagabond is merely wandering, the saunterer wanders with a generic aim whose specific- ity can be found only in the walking. 17. Bode, Portable Thoreau, p. 593. 18. Ibid. 19.

It appears that from early on, country women had a better sense of the ‘‘border life’’ Thoreau described. It’s not that they were less ‘‘wild,’’ but, perhaps because of the sexism they suffered under, they understood how to use their wildness more effectively. 3. Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K.

Clearly there are a number of male country stars one might use to investigate the male world of country music. I leave Elvis out of account here primarily because of his complexity and because his influence moved so directly beyond the world of country music. Others left out of consider- ation here include Lefty Frizzell, Merle Haggard, David Alan Coe, Roger Miller, Willie Nelson, and Jerry Jeff Walker, to name but a few. 14.

Out of this Austin movement there developed a long and rich tradi- tion of alternative country music that is not driven by high-end income or constrained by the mainstream, crossover sounds of Nashville. 21. If one suspects that the Grateful Dead are inappropriate in this con- text, it is important to note both Garcia’s roots in bluegrass and the various country influences on his style that can be found throughout the musical history of the Dead. Jackson Browne, although he blends folk and rock, writes with a strong country flavor. See, for example, his ‘‘Shaky Town’’ on Running on Empty. 22.

However, stan- dards need to be understood not as narrow formulas but as generic, regula- tive ideals that may be met in a variety of ways. It is always important to keep in mind the question What are the best ways to achieve one’s standards and to ensure they have a lasting effect? 8. Rebecca Hawthorne tells the interesting story of middle school teacher Cecilia Braddock. Braddock exercises her autonomy and displays all the traits of an outstanding teacher. However, to do so, she requires the as- sistance of her department chair: ‘‘Cecilia Braddock’s department chair acts as a buffer between Cecilia and the organization in which she works, pro- tecting Mrs. B’s highly prized autonomy by mediating her organizational ob- ligations.’’ Braddock’s case is not an unusual one.

It is one of the tragedies of our culture that we persistently work to lower the status of teachers. It is almost as if we culturally feel a need to reduce teachers to an ancillary status to make sure they don’t threaten some- one else’s status. 11. Carl Hausman, Discourse on Novelty and Creation (The Hague: Mar- tinus Nijhoff, 1975). 12. It is worth noting that the strand of postmodern thought which argues that all canons are socially constructed along political lines maintains its own canon which includes Derrida, Foucault, Lyotard, and others. The important point is that the success of Derrida and Foucault, for example, is in large measure a function of their extensive knowledge of and familiarity with the history of Western philosophy and their ability to write sophisticated philo- sophical texts. Their texts are not chosen randomly or arbitrarily, but be- cause they measure up to a working standard of philosophical expertise. 13. Though discussions of cherishing love or concern are not easy to find in textbooks for teaching teachers, they are not entirely absent from general discussions of teaching. See, for example, Alicia Fernandez, ‘‘Leadership in an Era of Change,’’ in The Life and Work of Teachers, ed. Day et al., pp. 239–55.

Stanley Cavell’s work on Emerson often raises this point—as, for ex- ample, when in his ‘‘The Division of Talent’’ (Critical Inquiry 11, no. 4 [June 1985]: 519–38) he places Emerson in the context of a Romanticism ‘‘whose defining mission’’ is ‘‘the redemption of philosophy and poetry by one an- other’’ (p. 521). Two points, however, make me shy from following Cavell more closely: (1) he tends to underplay Emerson’s influence on later Ameri- can thinkers—an influence important to the way I am reading Emerson, and 272 Notes to Pages 194 –99 (2) his labeling of Emerson as Romantic, while obviously accurate to some degree, seems to miss the streaks of shrewd, pragmatic commonsensism found throughout Emerson’s work. 13.

Harris, in his discussion of Emerson’s defining of ‘‘nature’’ in ‘‘Nature’’ (Essays: Second Series), also points out that Emerson probably in- tends this defining to be philosophical. Furthermore, he argues for the sub- tlety of the second ‘‘Nature’’ vis-a`-vis the first—a point many Emerson scholars seem unwilling to admit. 18.

There is some irony here, however, insofar as the literary appropria- tion of Emerson’s phrases and sentences has tended to mark him as a writer of quips and maxims. 21.

Although there is no room to make the case here, I see the essays aligned in a reciprocal order, as if meant to face and confront each other. Roughly, I align ‘‘History’’ and ‘‘Nominalist and Realist,’’ ‘‘Self-Reliance’’ and ‘‘Politics,’’ ‘‘Compensation’’ and ‘‘Nature.’’ Then, collectively, ‘‘Spiritual Laws,’’ ‘‘Love,’’ ‘‘Friendship,’’ ‘‘Prudence,’’ and ‘‘Heroism’’ face ‘‘Gifts,’’ ‘‘Manners,’’ and ‘‘Character.’’ Finally, ‘‘The Over-Soul’’ and ‘‘Circles’’ match ‘‘Experience,’’ and ‘‘Intellect’’ and ‘‘Art’’ are coupled with ‘‘The Poet.’’ I exclude ‘‘New England Reformers’’ because it was added later. 34.

In ‘‘The Dialectical Unity in Emerson’s Prose’’ Harris offers dialectical readings of ‘‘Experience,’’ Nature, and ‘‘The Over-Soul.’’ Again, despite the narrowing effect of his Hegelianism, Harris begins to suggest what it means to take Emerson seriously as a philosopher on his own terms. 37. It is true that the address ‘‘New England Reformers’’ was added to the end of the original eight essays. However, Emerson added it only after his publisher maintained that the initial collection was too short. Moreover, the address, in its emphasis on a particular aspect of lived experience, remains consistent with my general description of the two series of essays. 38.

I take James’s absence to be equally important. However, that marks a second project. For now, I confine myself to the limited mention of Dewey that Cavell provides. 4. See John Dewey, ‘‘Ralph Waldo Emerson,’’ in Emerson: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed. Milton Konvitz and Stephen Whicher (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1962), pp. 24–30.

For an account of Cavell’s intellectual background, see his interview with James Conant in The Senses of Stanley Cavell, ed. Richard Fleming and Michael Payne (Lewisburg, PA: Bucknell University Press, 1989), esp. pp. 33–37. 6. This failure to follow Rorty is perhaps less ironic than it seems, since Rorty squeezes much of the Emersonianism out of Dewey by eliminating interest in Dewey’s metaphysical thinking in Experience and Nature and Art as Experience. 7. John Edwin Smith, The Spirit of American Philosophy (New York: Ox- ford University Press, 1965). See, for example, pp. 140–142.

I mean to employ the ambiguity in the term ‘‘culture’’ here. Dewey’s rich notion of culture may in fact be part of the source of Cavell’s resistance to him. Cavell, in calling on psychoanalysis and modern art, seems to have in mind a more ‘‘cultured’’ culture. If this is the case, the challenge is for Cavell, not Dewey, to demonstrate his Emersonianism. 15. ‘‘Moral perfectionism’’ is Cavell’s term, and while he wants its mean- ing, in Emersonian fashion, to be exemplified by and disclosed through the whole of his text, he does offer a brief definition at the outset of the book: ‘‘Perfectionism, as I think of it, is not a competing theory of the moral life, but something like a dimension or tradition of the moral life that spans the course of Western thought and concerns what used to be called the state of one’s soul’’ (C:2). 16. Although Cavell does suggest that elements of this description fit Em- erson, he does not show just how close the fit might be. Consider, for exam- ple, the following from ‘‘Self Reliance’’: ‘‘Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day’’ (CW, 2:33). 17. Emerson, Nature, p. 95. 18. Ibid., p. 81. 19. Cornel West, The American Evasion of Philosophy: A Genealogy of Pragmatism (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989), p. 74. 20. Cavell displays this same misreading of Dewey’s notion of intelligence in This New Yet Unapproachable America, where he argues that for Dewey ‘‘the mission of philosophy is to get the Enlightenment to happen’’ (p. 95). 21. In the one place where Dewey is mentioned, Cavell again tries to sepa- rate him from Emerson. In discussing Emerson’s suggestion in ‘‘Experience’’ that certain features in experience veil us from nature, Cavell thinks he finds a significant point of difference: An opening and recurrent target of Dewey’s Experience and Nature is thinkers who take experience to ‘‘veil or screen’’ us from nature. Its dis- sonance with Emerson is interesting in view of Dewey’s being the major American philosopher who, without reservation, declared Emerson to be a philosopher—without evidently finding any use for him. (C:40) 276 Notes to Pages 216–21 It is interesting that Cavell should read both Dewey and Emerson with such abandon. Dewey did not, in his attacks on classical empiricism, mean that all experience speaks the truth, but that experience is not an epistemological prison in all its guises. Likewise, Emerson does not make experience neces- sarily imprisoning, but potentially (and in many cases effectively) so. For Emerson, the answer to skepticism was not philosophy alone but courage—a point I am not sure Cavell admits. The radical separation of Emerson and Dewey by way of their accounts of experience simply does not make sense. 22. I am well aware that my reading of Emerson here is much more straightforward than Cavell might wish. However, while I recognize the im- portance of reading Emerson with the irony and daring Cavell provides, I do not think the reading of Emerson ends there. However much Emerson sees philosophy transformed in his own Platonic adoption of the balance of poetry and philosophy, he still acknowledges strands of traditional ‘‘first philosophy’’ in his thinking. 23. For an excellent account of the importance of Emerson’s ‘‘social phi- losophy,’’ see Joseph L. Blau, ‘‘Emerson’s Transcendentalist Individualism as Social Philosophy,’’ Review of Metaphysics 31, no. 1 (September 1977): 80–92. 24. Contemporary students of Dewey might be as uncomfortable as Ca- vell with the lineage I am suggesting here. However, my point is not to re- duce one thinker to the other, but to show that by seeing the lineage we can find in both Emerson and Dewey possibilities that we might otherwise be tempted to overlook. 25. West, The American Evasion of Philosophy, p. 70. 26. In ‘‘Fate’’ Emerson takes up the presence of various encounters of and resistances to the developing selves of a community.
