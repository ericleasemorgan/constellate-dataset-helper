N O T E S 1—Gardens o f the Gilded Age 1. Richardson Wright in Henry Stuart Ortloff, A Garden Bluebook o f Annuals and Biennials (Garden City: Doubleday, Page & Company, 1924), p. x. 2. Walter E.

Wayne Morgan, revised edition (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1975), p. 2; and Arthur Meier Schlesinger, The Rise o f Modem America 1865-1931 (New York: Mac­ millan, 1959), p. 55. Change was not a characteristic applied to the nineteenth century only in retrospect: it was recognized as an active force by those who experienced the period. “There has never been in the history of civilization,” observed Edward Atkinson in 1891, “a period, or a place, or a section of the earth in which science and invention have worked such progress or have created such opportunity for material welfare as in these United States in the period which has elapsed since the end of the civil war.” Schlesinger, The Rise o f Modem America, p. 29. 3. Houghton, The Victorian Frame o f Mind\ p. 6. 4. At no time was the relationship of society and nature, of city and country, more studied in America than in the nineteenth century.

Once upon a time, “people did not run about the town or the land as we do. They travelled less often, did not hurry to catch trains, wrote one letter a morning instead of ten. Now, we are whirled about, and hooted around and rung up as if we were all parcels, booking clerks or office boys.” Houghton, The Vic­ torian Frame o f Mind, p. 7. 7.

Henry David Thoreau explodes the rural myth with comments on the “nobility” of the farmer: “I respect not his labors, his farm where everything has its price, who would carry the landscape, who would carry his God, to market, if he could get anything for him; who goes to market for his god as it is.” In Marx, Machine in the Garden, p. 258. 191 13.

In 1846, Alexander Mack described the village of Canandaigua: “The main road between Buffalo and Albany which passes through it, constitutes its principal street . . . which is about a mile long, is exceed­ ingly wide, and shaded on either side by an unbroken succession of lofty and magnificent trees. The houses on both sides, which are almost all detached from each other, are some distance back from the street, having gardens in front occupied by grass and flower plots, with clumps of green foliage overhead.” In Roger Haydon, Upstate Travels: British Views o f Nineteenth-Century New York (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1982), p. 189­ 18.

In the second edition of Downing’s Treatise on the Theory and Practice o f Landscape Gardening (1844), he writes, “There is no part of the Union where the taste in landscape gardening is so far advanced as on the middle portion of the Hudson.” 25. Norman T. Newton, Design on the Land: The Development o f Landscape Architecture (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1974), p. 266. Downing inculcated many aristocratic ideals, among them that gardens were a measure of civilized society. In 1845, when most of New York State was still frontier, he wrote, “So long as men are forced to dwell in log huts and follow the hunter’s life, we must not be surprised at lynch law and the use of the bowie knife. But when smiling lawns and tasteful cottages begin to embellish a country, we know that order and culture are established.” In Russell Lynes, The Tastemakers (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1954), p. 21. 26. Hudson River properties of note included Hyde Park (laid out by Andre Parmentier), Blithewood at Barrytown, Montgomery Place, Ellerslie, Linwood, The Locusts near Rhinebeck, Netherwood and High Cliff near New Hamburg, and Wodenethe (laid out by H. W. Sargent). 27. Frederica Bremer, The Homes o f the New World (New York: Harper, 1853), p. 46. 28. Calvert Vaux in Lynes, The Tastemakers, p. 32. 29. In 1850, Downing convinced a young English architect, Calvert Vaux, to join him in America as his partner. Seven years later, after Downing’s death, Vaux invited Frederick Law Olmsted to collaborate on a plan for Central Park in Manhattan. The two entered their “Greensward” plan into the competition and won. 30. The social and political aims of Central Park are revealed in the official description of the “Greens­ ward” plan by Vaux and Olmsted: “The primary purpose of the Park is to provide the best practical means of healthful recreation for the inhabitants of all classes. . . . It is the one great purpose of the Park to supply to the hundreds of thousands o f tired workers, who have no opportunity to spend their summers in the coun­ try, a specimen of God’s handiwork that shall be to them, inexpensively, what a month or two in the White Mountains or the Adirondacks is, at great cost, to those in easier circumstances.” Second Annual Report, Cen­ tral Park Commissioners, January 1, 1859, p. 44. Cited in Bruce Kelly, Gail Travis Guillet, and Mary Ellen W. Hern, Art o f the Olmsted Landscape, (New York: The Arts Publisher, 1981), p. 79. 31. Central Park was not the first public park designed in the natural style in America. In 1853, a fifty acre park was created from the slums o f Hartford, Connecticut. It was later named Bushnell Park, for the gentle­ man who first proposed it, fought for it, and was responsible for its romantic design.

Anna Warner, who had been brought up in a comfortable middle-class home, was compelled to earn a living because of financial reverses. She exercised her talent for writing on the topic she knew best, ama­ teur gardening. Gardening By Myself (New York: Anson D. F. Randolph, 1872) was directed to other women so they could turn to gardening for pleasure or profit, perhaps even achieving a degree of independence. Her advice was practical and her encouragement generous. Peter Henderson was both a seedsman and a prolific author. In addition to the horticultural advice he put forth in his annual catalogs, he wrote Gardening for Profit (1868), Practical Floriculture (1869), Garden­ ing for Pleasure (1875), Hendersons Handbook o f Plants (1881), and Garden and Farm Topics (1884). 48. In 1870, Frank J. Scott wrote The Art o f Beautifying Suburban Home Grounds o f Small Extent and dedicated it “To the memory of A. J. Downing, his friend and instructor, . . . with affectionate remem­ brance.” 1870 also marked the publication of Beautifying Country Homes by Jacob W eidenmann, an occasional collaborator of Frederick Law Olmsted. Both Scott and Weidenmann used scaled plans extensively throughout the texts. For greater insight on the state of landscape gardening at the close o f the nineteenth century, see Art Out-of-Doors by Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1893 and 1911). Mrs. Van Rensselaer was also a frequent contributor to Garden and Forest, a fashionable gardening periodical which appeared between 1888 and 1897. A bibliography on “Gardening Art from 1625 to 1890” appears as the appen­ dix of her book.

The larger part of our countrymen . . . find most delight in the natural landscape garden; but [for others], the classic villa, with its artistic adornments of vase and statue, urn and terrace, is an object o f much more positive pleasure than the most varied and seductive gardens laid out with the witchery of nature’s own handiwork.” 5.

One garden critic, commenting on excessiveness in planting, observed that, “The more a man loves, in an unreasoning way, the works of nature, the more likely he is to think that he cannot have too many o f them in his grounds, and no error is so fatal as this to a goodgeneralresult. And the stronger his horticultural passion, the more apt he is to care about novelties and eccentricities— about conspicuous plants as such; and the profuse use of these gives the last fatal touch to the inartistic disorder o f the usual overcrowded domain."

In lord and Burnham's greenhouse catalog of 1907, Mr. Burnham reminisced about early developments in the greenhouse industry. “Yes, enthusiasm has kept us always on the alert for new and better ways of doing things; has helped to make us pioneers along the line o f structural improvements. For instance, they formerly used bulky wooden rafters which excluded much o f the sunlight. We were the first to use steel rafters in place of wood. That was in 1881, on the big range o f greenhouses built for the late Jay Gould. We were also the first to substitute cast iron sills and gutters in place o f wood."
