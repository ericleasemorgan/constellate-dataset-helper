Abstract 
T-cell cancer therapy is a clinical field flush with opportunity.  It is part 
of the revolution in immuno-oncology, most apparent in the dramatic 
clinical success of PD-1/CTLA-4 antibodies and chimeric antigen 
receptor T-cells (CAR-Ts) to cure certain melanomas and lymphomas, 
respectively.  Therapeutics based on T cells ultimately hold more 
promise because of their capacity to carry out complex behaviors and 
their ease of modification via genetic engineering.  But to overcome 
the substantial obstacles of effective solid-tumor treatment, T-cell 
therapy must access novel molecular targets or exploit existing ones 
in new ways.  As always, tumor selectivity is the key. T-cell therapy has 
the potential to address target opportunities afforded by its own 
unique capacity for signal integration and high sensitivity.  With a 
history of breathtaking innovation, the scientific foundation for the 
cellular modality has often been bypassed in favor of rapid advance in 
the clinic.  This situation is changing, as the mechanistic basis for 
activity of CAR-Ts and TCR-Ts is backfilled by painstaking, systematic 
experiments—harking back to last century’s evolution and maturation 
of the small-molecule drug discovery field.   We believe this trend 
must continue for T-cell therapy to reach its enormous potential.  We 
support an approach that integrates sound reductionist scientific 
principles with well-informed, thorough preclinical and translational 
clinical experiments.

 If you have built castles in the air, your work need not 
be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the 
foundations under them.
Henry David Thoreau, Walden 1854
T-cell therapies are the future of oncology
It is astounding how the contents of the typical pharmacy 
have changed over the last 100 years. A century ago, pharmacists
stocked their shelves with aspirin, opiates, mercury, 
arsenic, magnesium sulfate, iodine and a few other substances 
of legitimate medical value (Pharmacopoeia of the US, 1907). 
Since then, hundreds of small-molecule drugs, dozens of recombinant
antibodies, and even a few nucleic acid therapeutics 
have been proven by rigorous scientific and clinical studies to 
treat a wide variety of human ailments. It is likely, however, 
that for a large number of patients yet to enjoy effective 
remedies for their disease, including cancer, cell therapy will 
ultimately provide the solution. 
This prediction follows from the inherent strengths of cells as 
therapeutic entities. T cells, for example, are honed by evolution
to execute numerous complex biological functions, 
among them identification and elimination of infected or damaged
tissue (Janeway et al., 1999). They have tremendous 
natural advantage over other therapeutic modalities that are often 
limited to a single activity: binding to other molecules. Simple
binding behavior may be sufficient to trigger salutary 
physiological changes and, indeed, there are many examples. 
However, the limitations imposed by having only hundreds of 
atoms like small molecules, or even thousands like antibodies, 
is evident. T cells, on the other hand, are composed of thousands
of different molecules, prewired by evolution to 
work in concert to accomplish tasks of extraordinary complexity
(Janeway et al., 1999). Specific killing is one of the 
simpler cellular behaviors, and is therefore among the first 
successful achievements of T-cell therapy, exemplified by 
three CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T 
cells) registered or close to registration (Abramson, 2020; 
Neelapu et al., 2017; Neelapu et al., 2020a; Schuster et al., 
2019). The next frontier for engineered T-cell therapy is solid 
tumors, which pose additional challenges. Perhaps most dramatically,
infused T-cell therapeutics directed against solid 
tumors must extravasate to reach their targets, targets that may 
be present on a subset of vital normal tissues as well. But cells 
have a second huge advantage as a therapeutic option: they 
can be readily manipulated with genetic alterations to augment 
or suppress their natural behaviors. The methods to do this 
are now routine and are improving with the advent of newer 
technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 (Cong et al., 2013; Jinek 
et al., 2012). Combined with cellular reprogramming technologies,
the possibilities to modulate natural cell properties or 
even create emergent ones are wide open (Takahashi & 
Yamanaka, 2006; Yu et al., 2007). T cells are naturally endowed 
with the attributes of (i) outstanding sensitivity, able to detect 
a handful of molecules on a cell surface; (ii) multivariate
signal integration, permitting them to react to different 
environments and discriminate among a variety of cell types; 
and, (iii) the capacity to proliferate. These traits are exactly 
those needed to overcome obstacles posed by solid tumor therapy.
We need to build a robust mechanistic foundation
To overcome the obstacles to solid tumor therapy, we must 
first recognize certain facts. A hallmark of the T-cell therapy 
field is striking innovation, with towering figures such as 
S.A. Rosenberg who has spent 40 years spearheading the 
clinical use of T cells in cancer (Fisher et al., 1989; Yron 
et al., 1980). Others, including G. Gross and Z. Eshhar 
(CAR), M.R. Roberts and M.H. Finer (Gen2 CAR), and 
V.D. Fedorov and M. Sadelain (iCAR) have designed robust 
novel receptors that can substitute for, or extend, T-cell 
receptor (TCR) function (Fedorov et al., 2013; Gross et al., 
1989; Roberts et al., 1994). Still others have made substantive
contributions to understanding, design and development of 
next-generation CAR-Ts; for example, C. June and P. Greenberg 
(see for review Guedan et al., 2019).
Notwithstanding the innovation and clinical success, the field 
lacks a strong foundation of mechanistic understanding. For 
example, there is not a broadly accepted model that explains 
key behavior of TCRs with respect to sensitivity and selectivity
toward their ligands, peptide major histocompat-
ibility complexes (pMHCs). CAR signaling, though understood 
in outline, also lacks important details (see for review 
Courtney et al., 2018; Nerreter et al., 2019). These gaps 
impede progress in areas that need to be addressed so that solid 
tumors can reliably and predictably be treated. It is instructive
to draw an analogy with small-molecule drug discovery, 
a field that developed over the 20th century from rudimentary 
industrial processes to a highly sophisticated discipline of quantitative
structure-activity relationships based on structural 
chemistry, computational modeling, and pharmacodynamic 
analysis in vitro and in vivo (Figure 1).
As an emerging field, engineered T-cell therapy is not on a 
similarly solid footing. The standard suite of in vitro assays is 
crude when compared to those used in modern small-molecule 
or antibody optimization laboratories. Assays that vary 
effector:target ratios are convenient, but have high background 
and poor dynamic range. They are typically insensitive 
and subject to conflation of important biological variables; 
for instance, T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity as well as 
target-cell proliferation over time (Rossi et al., 2018). 
      Amendments from Version 1
We thank the reviewers for their constructive comments and 
believe they have understood our key point: the need for funding 
agencies/departments to invest in foundational understanding 
of T-cell therapy, including preclinical mechanistic work. We point 
out that we intend our paper to be an opinion or perspective, 
and not a review. Consequently, we have limited some of the 
references and discussion.

 Primary human T cells are heterogeneous and cumbersome 
to grow, with considerable donor-to-donor variability; and 
the relationship between them and model cell lines, such as 
Jurkat, is not well understood (Salter & Creswell, 1986). 
Murine cancer models must also trade off tractability with 
relevance, and have some obvious prima facie weaknesses. 
Assays of therapeutic efficacy and safety in murine models are 
notoriously unpredictive for clinical behavior (Kamb, 2005). 
These deficits apply to small- and large-molecule therapeutic
discovery. In immuno-oncology specifically, even the 
best models use syngeneic grafts that do not originate in the 
host and, though matched at MHC, contain hundreds of nonsynonymous
mutations and elicit immune response1. Many 
experiments employ chimeric murine models with a complicated
mixture of murine and human immune components (e.g., 
humanized murine models, patient-derived xenografts). The 
human and mouse components of these chimeras, e.g., IL-2 
and IL-2R, do not mesh perfectly (Nemoto et al., 1995). These 
models have utility and are chosen for practical reasons, but 
they are often regarded as decisive in selection of clinical 
candidates because of presumptive experimental supremacy. 
In our view this is specious. The ultimate destination of a 
clinical candidate is the complex milieu of the human body 
and specifically the tumor microenvironment. But understanding
the steps that must occur, one by one, to achieve a successful 
outcome in the clinic should not be dismissed as irrelevant 
just because they are studied outside the system biology 
of a human body. In vivo experiments should be used and 
interpreted judiciously in the context of robust in vitro data. 
As a T-cell therapy example, simple xenograft models demonstrate
that therapeutic function is compatible with the 
environment of a mammalian body; nothing more, but nothing 
less.
Referencing small-molecule discovery again, the most successful 
efforts have involved deliberate construction of a mechanistic 
picture; from biochemical assays, through cell-based assays, 
to cautiously interpreted in vivo testing of pharmacodynamics. 
A clear example is the history of imatinib’s discovery 
(Buchdunger et al., 1996). T-cell therapy would benefit from 
adoption of this approach to control as many of the variables as 
possible within a reasonable timeframe of drug discovery. 
Only then can the predictability of the discovery process 
improve to the point needed to address the challenges of 
solid tumor therapy. If we wish to continue to innovate and

 not settle for incremental advances to CD19-directed therapies 
where there are currently hundreds of ongoing clinical 
trials for an unmet need, now estimated at ~6,000 deaths/year 
in the US, we must improve the mechanistic understanding and 
economical testing of candidate therapeutics. Otherwise, the 
opportunity costs will be enormous.
The acute shortage of solid-tumor drug targets: 
targeting genetic gains and losses
Selectivity is the supreme challenge of oncology. At the 
genetic level, a tumor differs on average at ~10,000 nucleotide 
positions from the normal tissues from which it arose—less 
than 0.01% of the human genome (Vogelstein et al., 2013). In 
contrast, siblings differ by about 10 million nucleotides. Perhaps 
even worse from a conventional therapeutic perspective, very 
few of these genetic changes are shared among a significant 
percentage of cancers. Only a handful of mutations, such as 
mutant KRAS and P53, occur at frequencies above 5% of cancers. 
The vast majority are private mutations unique to each tumor. 
For decades, drug discoverers have searched for “magic 
bullets” that can discriminate reliably among tumor and normal 
cells, with some success. Good examples include imatinib 
for chronic myeloid leukemia, which inhibits the Abl kinase, 
and rituximab, a CD20 antibody that mediates the destruction
of B-cell lineage cells such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(Anderson et al., 1997; Buchdunger et al., 1996). Both these 
medicines are extremely effective within the subset of cancers 
they are designed to treat. In solid tumors, there are a few 
proteins, known loosely as tumor-selective antigens, whose 
expression is sufficiently limited in adult normal tissues that 
they continue to attract attention as possible cancer targets. 
These include CEA, MSLN, PSMA, and the MAGE family 
members (Lu et al., 2017; Parkhurst et al., 2011).
In 2001 the complete human gene list of ~20,000 was defined, 
establishing a boundary for new discoveries. Cancer researchers
have scoured this gene set for the last two decades 
with diminishing success, visible in the shrinking, overlapping
group of cancer targets swarmed by academic research 
laboratories and pharma/biotech industry R&D organizations. 
We desperately need new options; and these will likely 
require utilization of known gene products in novel ways. 
Immuno-oncology offers prospects for doing so. The large 
majority of recurrent somatic mutations affect proteins 
expressed inside cells. Thus, it is necessary to overcome the 
barrier of the cell membrane that excludes antibodies and most 
other macromolecules to exploit somatic mutations as a source 
of selective cancer targets. The immune system has evolved 
the means to do so through the aegis of antigen presentation. 
Molecular complexes of major histocompatibility antigens 
bound to peptides derived from cellular proteins (pMHCs) give 
T cells a view of the internal contents of cells. Some of these 
pMHCs are likely the basis for PD-1 antibodies’ and tumor 
infiltrating lymphocytes’ (TILs) remarkable power to trigger 
tumor-specific killing by the immune system (Chamoto et al., 
2020; Hinrichs & Rosenberg, 2014). pMHCs that contain 
mutant peptides are currently the intended targets for numerous 
investigational vaccines and T-cell therapy efforts to engineer 
or select neoantigen-reactive T cells (Castle et al., 2019; Ng 
et al., 2019). The small number of recurrent mutations constrain 
the target options on this front. Though there are dozens—even 
hundreds—more private neoantigens, therapeutic exploitation 
of these via T cell engineering presents other challenges 
(Ng et al., 2019).
Loss of genetic material, rather than gain of somatic mutations, 
represents another opportunity to achieve absolute discrimination 
at the genetic level between tumor and normal cells. The 
most common form of genetic loss in cancer is loss of 
heterozygosity (LOH). An astonishing 20% of the genome 
in a typical cancer cell exhibits LOH. These LOH regions 
include loci that encode polymorphic surface antigens that 
can be recognized by T cells. Genetic loss is irrevocable and 
furnishes a basis for discrimination, provided a method can 
be devised to take advantage of LOH. The workings of a 
primordial branch of the immune system show the way. Natural
killer (NK) cells, which evolved before the adaptive 
immune system, employ a system of signal integration that 
differentiates self from non-self by combining inputs from 
families of activating and inhibitory receptors (Bryceson & 
Long, 2008). The logic of the NK system has been reproduced 
in an artificial circuit involving CARs (Fedorov et al., 2013). 
Versions of this basic circuit are capable in principle of utilizing
LOH as a black-and-white difference between tumor 
and normal cells (Hamburger et al., 2020). Other approaches 
are under study, including transcriptional logic circuits and 
receptor masking (Desnoyers et al., 2013; Roybal et al., 2016). 
These attempts to widen the target source for selective 
cancer targets to other targets, including neoantigens and LOH, 
are in their early stages, but they hold promise to dramatically
increase the therapeutic options available for solid tumor 
patients.
Additional challenges for T-cell therapy
The justifiable excitement around cancer T-cell therapy 
must be balanced with acknowledgement that many significant
challenges remain beyond tumor-selective targeting. 
Difficulties in T-cell manufacturing and delivery to patients 
translate into high production costs and time-delays (Fiorenza 
et al., 2020; Locke et al., 2020). Despite the technical 
hurdles, we view these issues as solvable through the 
iterative improvement cycles that are part of the standard 
practice of engineers. Efforts to automate, miniaturize and 
accelerate the production of autologous cells are underway 
(Castella et al., 2020). The opportunity to improve efficiency 
seems extremely attractive because the current doses of T 
cells range from 100 million to 100 billion cells—well beyond 
the number involved in a typical immune response in the 
body (Gudmundsdottir et al., 1999). Meanwhile, production 
methods for off-the-shelf allogeneic cell products have 
demonstrated early clinical success (Neelapu et al., 2020b). 
Perhaps more significant, efficacy to date in solid tumors is 
unimpressive and safety issues, either off- or on-target, continue

 to plague clinical programs (Lu et al., 2017; Norberg 
et al., 2020; Parkhurst et al., 2011). We believe these problems
are also solvable. They will be addressed by biological 
solutions, as they are not generally the result of limits 
imposed by laws of physics and chemistry which constrain 
more mature modalities. Indeed, there are a myriad of levers 
to pull to improve T-cell therapy outcomes. In some respects, 
the opportunity set for improved design of T-cell therapeutics
is so large, that the challenge is to prioritize and test the 
possibilities efficiently.
An approach to future T-cell therapeutic discovery
We do not subscribe to the common view that human 
testing always trumps preclinical data, not because it is false in 
concept, but because it is problematic in practice. Variation 
in the clinic is typically large, the number of observations 
small, the expense high and timelines long (Locke et al., 
2020; Silbert et al., 2019). We believe that well-designed 
preclinical experiments, interpreted within a solid framework 
of pharmacology and biology, will greatly aid analysis of 
clinical results, and in the long run support translational 
innovation that saves lives.
To this end, we propose a roadmap that begins by reducing 
the problem of solid tumor cell therapy into its components 
(Figure 2). These components incorporate essential requirements
for solid tumor cell therapy to achieve efficacy and 
safety, including that the engineered cells must: (i) survive 
in the body post infusion; (ii) migrate through the body’s 
tissues into the tumor microenvironment; (iii) overcome the 
potentially anti-inflammatory environment of the tumor; 
(iv) specifically recognize the tumor cells in a vast excess 
of normal cells; and, (iv) deliver a sustained cytotoxic blow 
sufficient to remove most, if not all, of the tumor bulk. These 
component activities can be parsed into scientific disciplines 
of biochemistry, pharmacology, cell biology, immunology, 
and tissue/organismal physiology. 
There are many potential differences between, for example, 
TCRs and CARs which have not been tested systematically,
and the field would benefit from their thorough 
examination (Table 1). It would be useful to have sufficiently 
large datasets to delineate the connection between tractable
models and the more complicated preclinical systems, 
and ultimately, the clinic. In particular, we believe that quantitative
assays that measure absolute sensitivity of receptors 
should be more widely employed, allowing direct comparisons 
among different targets and receptors. The collective time and 
expense on the one hand, and risk of irrelevant or non-robust 
results on the other, create significant overhangs for the field. 
Effort should be directed toward providing clear evidence to 
connect receptor properties to function, and T cell lines to 
primary cells. Given the potential importance of long-term 
survival and function of T cells for curative treatment of 
solid tumors, there is a pressing need for plausible in vitro 
models of chronic T cell activity. It is impractical to funnel 
large numbers of candidate receptors through in vivo models. 
This foundation-building work may not be glamorous, but 
is of great consequence and should be valued by scientific 
journals. Our strong view is that granting agencies should invest 
in foundation-building academic research, in part because 
shorter-term translational work is often attractive to the private 
sector. If the field as a whole invests to build the infrastructure
and expertise of better preclinical models and larger

Conclusion
The head of Novartis’ drug discovery organization, J. Bradner, 
reportedly expressed the opinion last year that “money and 
scientific resources are being poured into attempts to make 
incremental progress at a time when there is an urgent need 
for disruptive change” (Usdin, 2019). We agree with this 
perspective, but would add that without proper investment in 
foundational understanding of the science and technology, 
efforts to innovate further engineered T-cell therapies are likely 
to bog down in frustrating unpredictability. Risk tolerance 
must be wedded to broad, deep preclinical datasets that enable 
better prediction of outcomes on the clinical frontier.

I think that the revised version makes the author's intent in writing the review much more clear 
and is a valuable perspective.   
 
One small comment that I would suggest is changing the C. June and P. Greenberg mention: ‘nextgeneration
CAR-Ts' to 'CAR-Ts and TCR-Ts’ to more accurately describe Greenberg's work.

 particularly on cellular therapies, and outlines some of the fundamental scientific criteria that have 
been ‘by-passed’ in moving into the clinic, but that will likely need to be understood to make the 
cell-therapy approach applicable to solid tumors. 
 
I note the valuable comments of James et al., and in addition suggest:
As part of the “revolution in immune-oncology” seen with checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cells, 
the authors should acknowledge another ‘recombinant cellular therapy’ – oncolytic viruses. 
 
1. 
The authors are appropriately critical of mouse models that “trade off tractability with 
relevance“ and are then “often regarded as decisive in selection of clinical candidates 
because of presumptive experimental supremacy. In our view this is specious.” I agree 
completely! However given the ubiquity of these models regardless of therapeutic modality, 
it could be helpful to provide additional commentary as to how these models should be 
appropriately exploited.
2.

As part of the “revolution in immune-oncology” seen with checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T 
cells, the authors should acknowledge another ‘recombinant cellular therapy’ – 
oncolytic viruses. 
Our focus is on T-cell therapies, and not intended as an inclusive review. We 
have added “An opinion” to the title to clarify this. We acknowledge the interest 
of oncolytic viruses but do not see an unobtrusive way to feather them into our 
opinion piece.

because of presumptive experimental supremacy. In our view this is specious.” I 
agree completely! However given the ubiquity of these models regardless of 
therapeutic modality, it could be helpful to provide additional commentary as to how 
these models should be appropriately exploited. 
We appreciate this comment, and now include a statement about xenograft 
models as an example: As a T-cell therapy example, simple xenograft models 
demonstrate that therapeutic function is compatible with the environment of a 
mammalian body; nothing more, but nothing less.

The review deals with an important topic in T cell therapy - the use of appropriate methodology to 
increase mechanistic understanding and hopefully, eventually, translatability to the clinic. 
 
At the outset, the authors quote some pioneers in the field of T cell and CAR therapy. Although it’s 
not possible to add everyone, I would suggest that the addition of Phil Greenberg for his long 
history of pioneering work on TCR T cells and understanding how to apply engineering to these 
cells. Perhaps also Mike Jensen and Carl June for understanding the nature of first and second gen 
CAR T and scientists such as Malcolm Brenner for insights into competitive expansion of CARs in 
vivo are some suggestions for additions.  
Analogy between development of SM and T cell therapeutics is an interesting comparison. Text in 
diagram should perhaps be bigger and QSAR needs to be defined in the legend. 
 
The paragraph about building PD or mechanistic assays in the same spirit as the SM field is 
valuable but could be fleshed out more. E.g. The authors comment correctly that most work has to 
be done with primary cells since Jurkat unable to kill or behave in many other ways like normal T 
cells. There is reference to heterogeneousness, but perhaps calling out specifically that there is 
large donor to donor variability would be valuable. 
Adding to in vivo model difficulties I might talk about mouse cytokine environment not supporting 
human cells without model modification and in syngeneic models, inherent difficulties between 
human and mouse T cells such as the need for different signaling strengths.

 When pointing out shortcomings of screening approaches, say it needs to be more mechanistic. 
Some for instances might be useful, perhaps discussing possibilities for assays that might apply to 
parts of diagram 2, rather than the traditional endpoints in the T cell field of cytokine secretion, 
exhaustion markers or killing. Comments that in vivo assay can’t deal with high throughput of 
candidates is true, but there is the potential for rapid in vivo assay to potentially look at certain 
aspects covered in diagram e.g. migration, activation, specificity that are hard to cover in vitro. 
Perhaps a compare on contrast on this would be useful. 
 
Highlight other potential approaches to increasing tuor specificity e.g. synthetic biology from 
Wendel Lim or masking would be useful rather than just outlining one approach. 
 
Quotes that cell therapy doses can exceed 100 billion cells - seems like an outlier and more normal 
ranges should be quoted both for CARs and TCRs, especially in light of the table comparing CARs 
and TCRs and in fact cell dose could be added to this table.  
 
It was unclear to me if the table is meant to state dogma or the belief of authors. Some of the 
assumptions already have data challenging them and discussing some of this as a ‘start of the 
journey’ may be valuable, for example that CARs show good combination with PD-1 Abs in 
preclinical models. 
 
At the end, the authors make strong statements that better assays are needed, which I can’t argue 
with. Perhaps compare and contrast some assays and say what areas merit more development 
would be good. Potentials for solutions would make this review more valuable and might 
stimulate some of the general advances in the field that the review calls for.

 has to be done with primary cells since Jurkat unable to kill or behave in many other ways 
like normal T cells. There is reference to heterogeneousness, but perhaps calling out 
specifically that there is large donor to donor variability would be valuable. 
We have included text to call this variability out specifically: …with considerable 
donor-to-donor variability; 
 
Adding to in vivo model difficulties I might talk about mouse cytokine environment not 
supporting human cells without model modification and in syngeneic models, inherent 
difficulties between human and mouse T cells such as the need for different signaling 
strengths.  
We have added text to highlight this specific problem (i.e., the mismatch between 
mouse/human cytokine signaling that can be understood partly as divergence 
between ligands and receptor pairs over 90 million years of evolutions (e.g., IL-2 ligand 
and receptor): The human and mouse components of these chimeras, e.g., IL-2 and IL2R,
do not mesh perfectly (Nemoto et al., 1995). 
 
When pointing out shortcomings of screening approaches, say it needs to be more

assay to potentially look at certain aspects covered in diagram e.g. migration, activation, 
specificity that are hard to cover in vitro. Perhaps a compare on contrast on this would be 
useful. 
We agree with the reviewer and have pointed out the need to study certain aspects of 
T-cell biology in vivo, comparing mechanisms that can be studied in vitro with those 
that require in vivo experimentation. We have added to the legend of Fig. 2 a 
comment about the need for more mechanistic information. : This diagram illustrates 
the number and complexity of the steps required to achieve efficacy. Many of these 
steps can be studied in vitro; for others (e.g., extravasation), in vitro models are 
inherently problematic. 
 
Highlight other potential approaches to increasing tuor specificity e.g. synthetic biology 
from Wendel Lim or masking would be useful rather than just outlining one approach. 
We have mentioned the SynNotch approach of Dr. Lim and colleagues, (Williams et al., 
2020). We have also referenced ligand-binding domain masking approaches and added 
one reference (Desnoyers et al., 2013): Other approaches are under study, including 
transcriptional logic circuits and receptor masking (Roybal et al., 2016; Desnoyers et 
al., 2013). These attempts to widen the target source for selective cancer targets to 
other targets, including neoantigens and LOH,…

normal ranges should be quoted both for CARs and TCRs, especially in light of the table 
comparing CARs and TCRs and in fact cell dose could be added to this table.  
We have added a range of T-cell therapeutic doses and altered the sentence: …range 
from 100 million to 100 billion cells—well beyond the number…

connection among different targets and receptors: In particular, we believe that 
quantitative assays that measure absolute sensitivity of receptors should be more 
widely employed, allowing direct comparisons among different targets and receptors.

The review article from Kamb and Go provides an overview of how T-cell based therapies are 
being used in cancer treatment. The challenges arising from this approach and how the 
foundation of T-cell therapy research can be built for development of more potent treatment of 
solid tumours are discussed. Their main point is that in the rush to get CAR-T therapy to patients, 
some of the underlying foundational research has been bypassed, which needs to be ‘filled in’ so 
the potential benefits of T-cell therapies can be fully realised, which is of course an important 
concern to raise.

F1000Research 2020, 9:1295 Last updated: 04 JAN 2021
 There are a few points that should be addressed to improve this version of the manuscript:
The paper would be clearer if the authors could inform about the distinct challenges of CART
therapy used for treating blood cancers compared to those of solid tumours. At times, the 
information is overlapped and slightly unclear. 
 
○
In the early discussion of significant players in the CAR-T field, it is remiss not to state the 
contribution of Carl June’s lab. While much of his group’s work has primarily been in 
leukaemia rather than solid tumours, it has nonetheless provided real impetus that this 
approach could be transformational in cancer therapies. 
 
○
There is a slight pessimism to the state of knowledge on the mechanism of TCR triggering; 
while no true consensus will ever be reached on this question, there is little doubt that the 
fundamental aspects of this signal transduction have been elucidated. 
 
○
The authors compare the state-of-the-art development of small-molecule drugs to the 
equivalent process for T-cell based therapies. They argue that mouse models are not 
appropriate tools to study (human) immuno-oncology, which is of course strictly true but a 
charge that can be just as easily levelled at small-molecule drug approaches too and so 
perhaps unfair for T-cell therapies to be singled out. 
 
○
There is no mention of BiTE or ImmTAC therapeutics as alternative T-cell based therapies, 
which do have potentially greater likelihood of being effective in treating solid tumour 
masses. 
 
○
The authors have listed four additional requirements for effective and safe solid tumour 
therapy (page 5 under heading Additional challenges for T-cell therapy) along with 
identifying drug target. The review could do well with more information on these listed 
points such as current research being carried out to address these limitations. 
 
○
There are many labs around the world trying to combine engineering approaches to 
provide ‘logic-gating’ to CAR-T cell targeting. As the authors state, targets are hard to come 
by, but the potential for combinatorial CAR-T inputs (AND/NAND/NOT gating) significantly 
extends the usefulness of some likely targets to more accurately define solid tumour 
targets.  
 
○
Table 1 describes some commonly-held assumptions about T-cell therapies “not yet 
rigorously tested by mechanistic data”. The authors do provide a basis for these 
assumptions but no references to back these up. Whose “commonly held assumptions” are 
they?

We thank the reviewers for their constructive comments and believe they have 
understood our key point. We have attempted to address most of the reviewers’ 
suggestions in the planned revised publication. We point out that we intend our paper 
to be an opinion or perspective, and not a review. Consequently, we have limited some 
of the references and discussion.
The paper would be clearer if the authors could inform about the distinct challenges 
of CAR-T therapy used for treating blood cancers compared to those of solid tumours. 
At times, the information is overlapped and slightly unclear.
○
We agree and have added text to clarify the specific challenges of solid tumors. 
Perhaps most dramatically, infused T-cell therapeutics directed against solid 
tumors must extravasate to reach their targets, targets that may be present on 
a subset of vital normal tissues as well.   
 
○
In the early discussion of significant players in the CAR-T field, it is remiss not to state 
the contribution of Carl June’s lab. While much of his group’s work has primarily been 
in leukaemia rather than solid tumours, it has nonetheless provided real impetus that 
this approach could be transformational in cancer therapies.
○
We agree and have included Dr. June’s name and referenced his contributions. ○

 Still others have made substantive contributions to understanding, design and 
development of next-generation CAR-Ts; for example, C. June and P. Greenberg 
(see for review Guedan et al., 2019). 
 
There is a slight pessimism to the state of knowledge on the mechanism of TCR 
triggering; while no true consensus will ever be reached on this question, there is 
little doubt that the fundamental aspects of this signal transduction have been 
elucidated.
○
We do not intend pessimism, and have clarified our view that, though important 
basic mechanistic questions remain (e.g., altered-peptide ligands, APLs), the TCR 
and CAR signaling mechanisms are understood in outline at least (a good 
example is the work of Dr. James): For example, there is not a broadly accepted 
model that explains key behavior of TCRs with respect to sensitivity and 
selectivity toward their ligands, peptide major histocompatibility complexes 
(pMHCs). CAR signaling, though understood in outline, also lacks important 
details (see for review Courtney et al., 2018; Nerreter et al., 2019). 
 
○
The authors compare the state-of-the-art development of small-molecule drugs to 
the equivalent process for T-cell based therapies. They argue that mouse models are 
not appropriate tools to study (human) immuno-oncology, which is of course strictly 
true but a charge that can be just as easily levelled at small-molecule drug 
approaches too and so perhaps unfair for T-cell therapies to be singled out.
○
We agree wholeheartedly and have clarified this point: These deficits apply to 
small- and large-molecule therapeutic discovery. 
 
○
There is no mention of BiTE or ImmTAC therapeutics as alternative T-cell based 
therapies, which do have potentially greater likelihood of being effective in treating 
solid tumour masses.
○
We know these modalities well, but believe that cell therapy holds more 
promise for solid tumor therapies. Cells can be engineered, if they do not do so 
already, to distribute into tissues. Large molecules (soluble proteins) are much 
more limited in what they can be engineered to do, beyond binding things, and 
are constrained by their physico-chemical properties.  
 
○
The authors have listed four additional requirements for effective and safe solid 
tumour therapy (page 5 under heading Additional challenges for T-cell therapy) along 
with identifying drug target. The review could do well with more information on these 
listed points such as current research being carried out to address these limitations.
○
We should be clear that we do not intend to review the topic; our publication is 
more properly classified as an opinion piece. These topics are beyond the scope 
of our paper, and there are numerous reviews in the literature. 
 
○
There are many labs around the world trying to combine engineering approaches to 
provide ‘logic-gating’ to CAR-T cell targeting. As the authors state, targets are hard to 
come by, but the potential for combinatorial CAR-T inputs (AND/NAND/NOT gating) 
significantly extends the usefulness of some likely targets to more accurately define 
solid tumour targets.

 We have added a sentence to emphasize this point; i.e., that there are other 
logic systems beyond the AND NOT logic we describe in brief: Other approaches 
are under study, including transcriptional logic circuits and receptor masking 
(Roybal et al., 1995; Desnoyers et al., 2013). These attempts to widen the target 
source for selective cancer targets to other targets, including neoantigens and 
LOH… 
 
○
Table 1 describes some commonly-held assumptions about T-cell therapies “not yet 
rigorously tested by mechanistic data”. The authors do provide a basis for these 
assumptions but no references to back these up. Whose “commonly held 
assumptions” are they? 
○
We encounter people with different subsets of these assumptions frequently, 
but it is difficult to provide a suitable reference. We have changed the wording 
of the Table 1 title and in the text: There are many potential differences 
between, for example, TCRs and CARs which have not been tested 
systematically, and the field would benefit from their thorough examination 
(Table 1). We are certainly open to alternative phrasing.

○
We strongly agree that there should be investment in foundation-building academic 
research by granting agencies, and have added this opinion explicitly: Our strong view 
is that granting agencies should invest in foundation-building academic research, in 
part because shorter-term translational work is often attractive to the private sector.
