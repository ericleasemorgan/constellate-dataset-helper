I capitalize “Black” in this study in keeping with what has increasingly become standard usage in American studies and critical race studies scholar- ship. I make this choice in sympathy with this usage’s assertion that, at least in North Ameri c a, to have black skin is to belong, ascribe, or be assigned to Blackness as an identity, and in support of this usage’s instinct to combat, even in this small way, the systematic devaluation of Black life. The decision to capitalize Black is, however, not a s imple one, particularly in the context of this book, which w ill critically examine the historical emergence of modern racialist thought—i ncluding the notion that skin color confers identity. Indeed, at issue throughout this study will be a tension between the kinds of idealism needed to posit stable identities (racial or otherw ise) and materialisms in which stable identities—i ndeed, in which all nouns, proper or otherw ise—a re untenable in light of the porosity, mutuality, and pro- cessual changefulness of embodied being. This friction between the reification of identity signaled by the capitalization of “Black” and the dissolution of identity implicit in both antebellum and cont emporary posthumanist materialisms will come into part icu l ar focus in Chapter 4 and the Coda, which mine the commonalities and conflicts beween posthumanist and social justice theories. 3. In works like The Order of T hings and The Birth of Biopolitics, Foucault dates this transformation in the Western conception of Man to philosophi- cal changes brought about by Enlightenment sciences. However, postcolo- nial theorists including Sylvia Wynter argue that Western colonialism in the three centuries prior to this moment “prepare[d] the way for changes in the second modernity which are often thought to be the exclusive domain of Enlightenment thought” (Suarez-K rabbe, Race, Rights, and Rebels, 7. See also Wynter, “1492.”) 4. Foucault, History of Sexuality, 142. 173 174 Notes to pages 2–4 5. Foucault, Order of Things, 346. 6. Readers interested in tracing the paths of these discourses prior to where this study takes them up might begin with Kramnick’s study of embodied accounts of action in eighteenth- century philosophy and lit er a ture, in Actions and Objects; Richardson’s examination of embodied accounts of mind in romantic- era science and lit er a ture in British Romanticism; and Murison’s survey of embodied accounts of mind in nineteenth- century American popu lar culture and lit er a ture in Politics of Anxiety. 7. Nott and Gliddon, Types of Mankind, 54. 8. As Wynter (“On How We Mistook”) describes this, the biologization of man thus effects an “overall devalorization of the human species” by draining “the h uman” of the moral significance— the unique and universal freedom from material causality— that humanism had accorded it. To unpack this point more fully: whereas humanist “Man” is morally distinct from all other organisms by virtue of his freedom from his body, the biological human is strictly an embodied organism. It may therefore be distinguished from other embodied organisms by differences of degree but not by differences of moral kind: it is endowed with features that character- ize the physical uniqueness of the species Homo sapiens, but the materialist idiom to which this figure belongs prevents it from laying claim to features (e.g., soul, moral freedom) that are categorically exceptional to the material order. Thus biological humanity may be more sentient or more communica- tive or more cognitively complex than other species, but in the end t hese embodied features do not amount to a categorical break such as that posited by the doctrine of humanity’s transcendence of its materiality that has traditionally grounded claims for humanity’s unique moral value. 9. Russ Castronovo’s influential argument in Necro Citizenship, for instance, divides this era into two ideological camps, with liberal humanists committed to a disembodied and generic personhood on the one side, and racists, who “sentenced women and slaves to excessive and lethal embodi- ment,” on the other (10). Castronovo’s thesis— that liberalism can be as hard on the body as racism—is incisive about the limitations of liberal person- hood. However, it also risks flattening the field of antebellum embodied thought. For while it’s entirely true that the rising cachet of biological materialism was deployed to underwrite racist and sexist exclusion, racism and sexism w ere not the only ideologies of embodiment circulating in antebellum Amer i ca. Thus my readings of antislavery materialism in Frederick Douglass, Henry David Thoreau, and Walt Whitman endeavor to show how these authors navigated between Castronovo’s punishing either/ or, threading the needle between the disembodied universalism of abolition- ist humanism and the dehumanizing hierarchies of biological racism.

Alaimo and Hekman, Material Feminisms, 1, 3. 13. I also prefer “posthumanism” to the alternative term currently in circulation— “nonhumanism”— because in the context of my analy sis of race and slavery, “nonhumanism’s” closer rhetorical connection to animals and animality may invite readers to assume that any argument with humanism is an argument for the dehumanization of p eoples. It is precisely my purpose here to complicate this sort of assumption. For alternative perspectives on what name this broad theoretical re orientation ought to go by— posthumanism, nonhumanism, inhumanism, and the like— see, for instance, Luciano and Chen, “Has the Queer Ever Been Human?” 195–96.

American fugitive slave James W. C. Pennington attests to this logic when he writes, “The being of slavery, its soul and its body, lives in the chattel princi ple, the property princi ple, the bill of sale princi ple. . . . Y ou cannot constitute slavery without the chattel princi ple” (quoted in David Brion Davis, Inhuman Bondage, 193). 23. Foucault, Birth of Biopolitics, 271. See also Wynter, “On How We Mistook,” 122–26. Note that this biologization of “Man” is sometimes sold as part of a story about the secularization of modernity, but it is nothing so simple as that. As J. Kameron Car ter notes, “the discourse of theology aided and abetted the pro cesses by which ‘man’ came to be viewed as a modern, racial being,” while at the same time theology itself underwent a “subtle, inner transformation . . . in giving itself over to the discursive enterprise of helping to racially constitute the modern word as we have come to know it” (Race, 3). H ere I depart from Wynter’s suggestion that biologized Man is a “purely secular” figure (“On How We Mistook,” 123). 24. Foucault, Society Must Be Defended, 245. 25. Ibid., 245.

Although Foucault h ere notes racism’s enabling relation to biopower, he nonetheless arguably underesti- mates the centrality of racism to the biopo liti cal order. In defining racism’s role in biopower in Society Must Be Defended, Foucault ambivalently repre- sents racism as endemic to biopolitics or, alternatively, as supplementary to biopolitics (as he writes, “racism intervenes” in the biopo liti cal state’s commitment to cultivating populational life in order to introduce a rationale for making or letting some of that population die [254]).

Esposito defines “the flesh” as the continuum of living matter that “precedes the body,” constituting “a being that is both singular and communal, generic and specific . . . u ndifferentiated and dif fer ent” (Esposito, Bios, 167). 36. Puar, “ ‘Rather Be a Cyborg,’ ” 57. 37. Bennett, Vibrant Matter; Mel Chen, Animacies. See also Latour, Politics of Nature. Because it envisions life as an entangled continuum or network of being, posthumanism is sometimes described as framing a nongenocidal or “affirmative biopolitics” (Esposito, Bios)— a politics that refuses to inscribe lethal “caesuras” or value distinctions within life but instead embraces what Foucualt (Society Must Be Defended) terms “life itself” as a field unstratified by hierarchies of racial, sexual, or speciological difference. Along t hese lines, Giorgio Agamben calls for “a politics in which bare life is no longer separated and excepted”—in which the material plenum of being is no longer artifi- cially segregated into selected (“fully” h uman) and dysselected (“bare” or nonhuman) forms (Agamben, Homo Sacer, 9). 38. For instance, several new works in medieval studies spotlight proto- posthumanisms in medieval texts. See Mitchell, Becoming Human; Notes to pages 13–24 177 Joy and Dionne, “When Did We Become Post/Human?”; Cohen, Medieval Identity Machines. Or again, although t hese studies do not mention posthumanism by name, Justin E. H. Smith’s investigation of Leibniz’s proto-b iological empiricism and Jonathan Kramnick’s exploration of the philosophy of action and m ental causation in the eighteenth- century novel are examples of scholarship that points the way to a prehistory of con- temporary posthumanism in early modern and Enlightenment thought.

The framers of the Constitution deferred the question of suffrage to the states, most of whose laws of suffrage remained largely unchanged from the pre– Revolutionary War era. While the rules of suffrage in most states were modeled on British law, t here were variations in property, race, and sex requirements from state to state. 2. Adams cited in Keyssar, Right to Vote, 1. As Keyssar notes, although the irrationalism of the poor was the most commonly cited rationale for not enfranchising them, this argument “that the poor should not vote because they had ‘no w ill of their own’ coexisted with an altogether contradictory argument, often expressed by the same p eople: that the poor or propertyless should not vote because they would threaten the interests of property— that is, they would have too much w ill of their own. If men without property could vote, reflected the judicious conservative John Adams, ‘an immediate revolution would ensue’ ” (Keyssar, Right to Vote, 9). 178 Notes to pages 24–31 3. Ibid., 35. The proposition Keyssar is quoting, “that e very full- grown, featherless biped, who wears a hat instead of a bonnet, has a natu ral right to vote,” is G. S.

As Kyla Schuller argues, racial scientists often explic itly positioned their empiricism (which is based upon sensory experience) as offering a usefully restrained antidote to antislavery sentimentalism. As she writes, in this discourse “the Anglo- Saxon female absorbs the instability of impress- ibility and its tendency to excess, leaving her male counterpart to enjoy the benefits of sentiment while relieving him of the liabilities of sentimentality” (“Taxonomies of Feeling,” 278). Dana D. Nelson examines the role of sentiment in polygenist science in “ ‘No Cold or Empty Heart.’ ” 13. Nott and Gliddon, Types of Mankind, 457. 14. Linnaeus cited in Agamben, Open, 24. 15. Jordan cited in Bay, White Image, 19. 16. Tucker, Moment of Racial Sight, 61. 17. Thus, for instance, Nancy Stepan won ders “why it was that, just as the battle against slavery was being won by abolitionists, the war against racism in Eu ro pean thought was being lost,” and Susan Buck- Morss lam- bastes the “glaring discrepancy between thought and practice” in the era of liberalism and slavery. Stepan, Idea of Race in Science, 1; Buck- Morss, “Hegel and Haiti,” 821. 18. As Tucker argues, racialism is the direct product of “two not entirely compatible princi ples of the [Enlightenment] era: a commitment to univer- sal equality and a commitment to the truth of evidence drawn from empiri- cal observation” (Moment of Racial Sight, 25). 19. Samuel Stanhope Smith, Essay, 204. 20. “Are not the blacks of Guinea, the dwarfs of Siberia, degenerate races compared with the inhabitants of France, or E ngland, of Turkey, or Persia?,” Smith rhetorically asks (ibid., 311). Notes to pages 31–34 179 21. Thus Smith assures us that even the “degenerate” Guinean and Siberian “are found to improve in their appearance and form, by being removed from their own climate,” even as “the Eu ro pean, on his removal to Africa or Lapland,” comes to bear “a nearer resemblance to the natives of t hose countries” (ibid., 311). Already, he observes, “The American negro is visibly losing the most uncouth peculiarities of the African person” (252). 22. Frederickson, Black Image, 97. 23.

For instance Agassiz, a steadfast creationist, defended his polygenist views by arguing that the “greatness, prescience, omniscience, [and] provi- dence” manifest in the orderly distribution of life on earth could only be the handi work of God, proving that species have not haphazardly migrated across the earth and evolved, “but have made their successive appearance upon earth by the immediate intervention of the Creator” (Agassiz, Contri- butions, 135). Elsewhere, Samuel Cartwright defended the scriptural bona fides of polygenism with a complicated biblical hermeneutics, arguing that in the original Greek, Genesis 1:24 refers to the separate creation of Black and Native American races among the “living creatures” and “beasts of the earth” that God creates before Adam. “If the 24th verse of the 1st chapter were literally and fully translated, it would save the necessity of torturing Scripture and scientific truth to procure a white f ather and m other for the Missouri negroes and the Missouri Indians,” he concludes (Cartwright, “Unity of the H uman Race,” 132). For a full account of the polygenist reading of Genesis, see Frederickson, Black Image, 86–89. For a broader and trenchant discussion of the anachronism of trying to distinguish “scientific” from “theological” argument in midcentury racial science, see Hickman, “Douglass Unbound,” 323–62. 29.

Thus, as Thomas Cobb concludes in his 1858 Inquiry into the Law of Negro Slavery in the United States 180 Notes to pages 34–41 of Amer i ca, the difference between polygenism and monogenism is “much- mooted”: “ Whether the negro was originally a dif fer ent species, or is a degeneration of the same, is a m atter indifferent in the inquiry as to his proper status in his pres ent condition” (Cobb, Inquiry, 27). 34.

I sense a version of this reluctance to embrace Douglass’s post- Garrisonian politics in the tendency of several readers to stress the continu- ity between Douglass’s pre- and post- Garrisonian biographies. Thus, for instance, Elizabeth Barnes and Colleen Glenney Boggs suggest that in My Bondage and My Freedom (1855) Douglass does not distance himself from the rhe toric of sympathy and moral suasion but rather deploys it in modified form.

T here he advises, “All loud and boisterous commands, all brutal flogging should be banished from the field, and only words of cheer and encouragement should be tolerated. A h orse is in many re spects like a man. He has the five senses, and has memory, affection and reason to a limited degree. . . . C onvince him that he is a creature of law as well as of freedom by a judicious and kindly application of your superior power, and he will conform his conduct to that law, far better than your most law- abiding citizen” (Douglass, Address).

However, I do suggest that he has begun to understand slavery’s moral dimension as unnecessary— though by no means irrelevant—to the argument for abolition (Giles, “Narrative Reversals and Power Exchanges,” 803). 89.

Nott and Gliddon, Types of Mankind, 50. 3. Cameron, Writing Nature; Buell, Environmental Imagination; Walls, Seeing New Worlds. 4. Mid- twentieth- century critics tended to portray Thoreau as a somewhat tragic figure, an aspiring Transcendentalist who fi nally retreated into the privacy of nature in the late 1850s out of frustration with his failure in the literary marketplace, or because age had sapped his youthful capacity for poetic inspiration. See Miller, Consciousness in Concord; and Paul, Shores of Amer i ca. Versions of these theses also appear in Van Doren, Henry David Thoreau; and Hodder, Thoreau’s Ecstatic Witness. By contrast, in the wake of Cameron’s pathbreaking study of Thoreau’s Journal (Writing Nature), Buell’s monumental Environmental Imagination, and Walls’s landmark Seeing New Worlds, the prevailing narrative has been that Thoreau’s empiricism or “ecocentrism” displaced his interest in natu ral symbols, thus yielding a discourse on nature that was less and less prone to moral reflection and parable making. Of t hese three foundational studies, Walls’s stands out for resisting the hypostasized distinction between human and natu ral history that, as I argue above, funds the conclusion that Thoreau’s naturalistic studies are premised upon a relinquishment of concern for the social world. 5. Buell, Environmental Imagination, 138, 135. 6. Buell thus concludes that “the hypothesis of Thoreau as ‘deep ecologist’ ” helps us “to overcome the traditional opposition between the ‘naturist’ and the ‘social protester’ ” (Environmental Imagination, 369). That the politics we associate with Thoreau’s late naturalism are more or less strictly environmentalist is suggested by the fact that none of t hese three impor tant studies of Thoreau’s late works mentions the antislavery essays he wrote for John Brown at the height of his “ecocentric” phase. 7.

Lurie, Louis Agassiz, 135; James, “Louis Agassiz,” also cited in Walls, “Agassiz,” 15. In giving this account of Agassiz’s preeminence in midcentury U.S. scientific circles, I am arguably falling into what Branka Arsić describes, in her dazzling reading of Thoreau’s vitalism, as a misguided tendency to assign Agassiz “the central place in our understanding of natu ral science at Harvard in the 1840s” (134–35). The prob lem with this, Arsić argues, is that the overrepre sen ta tion of Agassiz and his theory of sequential special creation has functioned to eclipse attention to the strong and countervailing tradition of vitalist science at Harvard that crystallized in the 1820s and 1830s. I am grateful to her study for highlighting this vitalist tradition as one source of Thoreau’s own anti- Agassizian science, and although her book was not yet available when I wrote this chapter, I now find that my own reading of Thoreau’s materialism often resonates strongly with hers (as I shall note below). On this par tic u lar point, though, I would nonetheless maintain that in the de cade upon which I am focusing (the 1850s), Agassiz’s recent arrival and unpre ce dented visibility at the helm of Harvard’s new school of science did, in fact, put Harvard’s remaining vitalists in the shade. Although science at Harvard remained theoretically diverse (as demonstrated by Asa Gray’s public debates with Agassiz over Darwinian evolution), in the 1850s Agassiz’s outsized reputation meant that it was his theory of creation and his methodologies that Thoreau felt compelled to contend with.

See Arsić, Bird Relics, for an illuminating account of how this “quintessentially materialist” epistemology generates, in Thoreau, a style and theory of communication committed to what she terms “literalization,” a pro cess that involves “turning the word into some sort of t hing, capable of affecting bodies; and bringing words closer to objects, recovering the presence of objects in names” (8). 39.

Reflecting on this passage, Robert Richardson argues that “it is highly likely that the problematic scientist challenged in the passage is Louis Agassiz, and much of Thoreau’s longstanding ambivalence about science— though not about natu ral history or botany or zoology— can be understood in the context of his long association with and eventual rejection of the views of Louis Agassiz” (Richardson, Henry Thoreau, 363). 43.

Along t hese lines, Darwin outlines his theory of the social construc- tion of speciological difference in On the Origin of Species, concluding that “va ri e ties cannot be distinguished from species,” and that all currently acknowledged species “once existed as va ri e ties, and thus originated” via speciation (47–48). In “Taxonomies of Feeling,” Kyla Schuller profiles a fascinating riposte to Darwinian evolution formulated in the 1870s by the “American School of Evolution,” which sought to reconcile the fluidity of 186 Notes to pages 75–79 species with racist hierarchy. Led by Alexander Cope, this alternative school of evolution held that insensibility to influence is a defining feature of inferior races, whereas superior races are correspondingly more impression- able and susceptible to change. Intriguingly, if one can bring oneself to bracket its racist agenda, this theory’s insistence that sensibility rather than sexual se lection is the mechanism of h uman development bears certain affinities with Thoreau’s sensuous empiricism. 46.

It is pos si ble that Thoreau attended one or more of Gray’s lectures: Thoreau was in Boston on December 10, 1858, when Gray delivered his first paper in support of Darwin’s theory at the Cambridge Scientific Society, and he was again in Boston January 11, 1859, when Gray presented crucial evidence that Notes to pages 79–83 187 he had been supplying to Darwin about the similarity between Japa nese and North American plants. 61.

Walls, Seeing New Worlds, 204. 71. I am grateful to Bill Rossi for pointing out to me Thoreau’s horticul- tural pun on “bizarre.” 72. Fleck, Indians of Thoreau, 7. It is unclear whether Thoreau planned to write a book on “the history and qualities of the North American Indian” (as his friend Franklin Sanborn once attested), or w hether, as Robert Sayre argues, this research was merely source material for other proj ects. Either way, Thoreau was committed to this work, adding an average of twenty- four pages of notes per month to his “Indian Books” e very year from 1850 through 1861. See Sayre, Thoreau and the American Indians; I have compiled Thoreau’s page average from Sayre’s t able (110), absenting notebook 2, whose dates are unknown. The standard deviation is eleven pages. 73. Between 1856 and 1861, Thoreau read several works of racial science as well as others that included scientific speculations about Native American racial origins. Indeed, Joshua Bellin suggests that the late notebooks “palpably gain in excitement (as mea sured by authorial commentary) whenever talk of origins enters their orbit” (Bellin, “In the Com pany of Savagists,” 10). The polygenist texts Thoreau read include Morton’s Crania Americana (Thoreau had also visited Morton’s skull collection in Philadel- phia in 1854), Charles Pickering’s The Races of Man, and Nott and Gliddon’s two collections, Types of Mankind and Indigenous Races of the Earth (although not listed in Sattelmeyer’s indispensable index, Thoreau’s Reading, Thoreau’s notes on Indigenous Races appear in “Indian Notebooks,” 12). Both of the latter two volumes prominently feature contributions by Agassiz. However, Thoreau read a greater number of texts sympathetic to some version of monogenism. In 1856 he took fifty- eight pages of notes on James Adair’s 188 Notes to page 83 History of the American Indians, a book offering “observations, and argu- ments, in proof of the American Indians being descended from the Jews,” and which refers to its subjects as “the copper colour American Hebrews” (96). Thoreau also perused a strange l ittle book by George Burder titled The Welch Indians, which speculates about “a p eople whose ancestors emigrated from Wales to Amer i ca, in the year 1170, with prince Modoc” and who “are now said to inhabit a beautiful country on the west side of the Mississippi” (Burder, Welch Indians). In addition, in 1851 he read Arnold Guyot’s Earth and Man, and in 1856 he read Benjamin Smith Barton’s New Views on the Origin of the Tribes and Nations of Amer i ca. 74. Of course, it is impossible to know with certainty what Thoreau thought of the statements he copied out from his readings, since the “Indian Notebooks” chiefly contain transcriptions with very l ittle personal commen- tary. Nonetheless, t here is a subtly subversive logic to Thoreau’s transcrip- tions from the polygenist works he read, which suggestively corroborates the developmentalist outlook of his Journal. For one t hing, his engagements with polygenist texts tend to be rather perfunctory: on Nott and Gliddon’s 650- page tome, Indigenous Races of the Earth, Thoreau took a comparatively scant seven pages of notes. Moreover, in t hese few pages he seems to be seizing on moments in which the argument for polygenism is particularly wobbly. Thus, for instance, from Joseph Leidy’s prefatory letter to the volume, Thoreau excerpts the author’s admission that “neither upon nor beneath the surface of the earth” are “the bones of the generations of red- men, of herds of bison, and of other animals which have lived and died in past ages” to be found. As Thoreau dutifully rec ords, Leidy speculatively attributes this absence of a fossil rec ord to the work of “devouring succes- sors, and the combined influence of air and moisture, [which] have com- pletely extinguished their traces.” From here, however, Thoreau’s notes skip two pages ahead in Leidy’s account to his conclusion that “it is quite as probable that the [American Indian] had his origin on this continent, as that men originated elsewhere,” Leidy insists. Thoreau’s selective transcriptions thus highlight how Leidy inexplicably converts the total lack of physical evidence for the ancient tenure of human beings in the Amer i cas into proof of the Native American’s perpetual residence therein. Leidy is not the only victim of Thoreau’s silently critical reading practice. Later in his notes on Indigenous Races, Thoreau juxtaposes two passages from J. Aitken Meigs’s contribution to the volume (an essay on “The Cranial Characteristics of the Races of Men, with eighty- seven woodcuts”). First he transcribes Meigs’s citation of Morton’s raciological distinction between Appalachian p eoples and p eoples living west of the Alleghenies on the grounds that the latter, as Morton observes, have distinctly elongated skulls. Notes to pages 83–84 189 Without a break in his page, Thoreau next copies a passage from three pages later in this essay, in which Meigs acknowledges evidence that “the Huns used artificial means for giving Mongolian physiognomy to their c hildren . . . in an effort to approach a [flattened and elongated] form, which, among the Huns, was held in greater regard.” Read sequentially, as Thoreau’s selective transcription offers them, t hese two moments show how the craniometrical method Morton and Meigs use to construct their racial typographies may be unreliable, given the susceptibility of skulls to cultural practices of artificial shaping. (J. Meigs, “The Cranial Characteristics of the Races of Men,” in Nott and Gliddon, Indigenous Races, 332, 335; cited in Thoreau, “Indian Notebook,” 12). In the Journal, Thoreau makes similar use of Charles Pickering’s Races of Man in 1853, from which he transcribes a passage noting that Aesop’s fables migrated eastward to Madagascar and Malaysia. “A fame on its way round eastward with the Malay race to this western continent!,” Thoreau crows, at the end of his citation: “P. gives California to the Malay race!” (Journal 7:30 [September 1, 1853]). Or again, a fter reading Morton’s Crania Americana in 1852, Thoreau takes par tic u lar note of an anecdote Morton relates about how Chinese porcelain vessels had been found in the catacombs of Thebes in Egypt. While Thoreau’s comments on this story focus on the Chinese inscription (which celebrates the coming of lilies in spring), he was no doubt pleased with this evidence of intercontinental intercourse “as old as the Pharaonic period” (Journal 5:204 [July 9, 1852]). Indeed, that Thoreau understood this anecdote to be relevant to the question of racial unity is supported by the fact that sentences from this journal entry end up in the concluding discussion of “Slavery in Mas sa chu setts.” 75. Barton, New Views, v. Thoreau’s notes on Barton appear in “Indian Notebook,” 10. Thoreau, Journal (transcript), September 27, 1857. Thoreau’s journal entry suggests that by 1857 he had rejected Guyot’s theory that Native Americans migrated to North Amer i ca from the west, a theory that (as Schneider points out) had inspired Thoreau’s musings on humankind’s westering instinct in “Walking,” first drafted in 1851. 76.

Richardson argues that after the memorial ser vice for Brown on December 2, 1859, “Thoreau’s absorption in John Brown ceased almost as suddenly as it began. By December 8, 1859, Thoreau had picked up his natu ral history pursuits again and was absorbed in another rediscovery, this time of Aristotle on animals, and the writings of the roman naturalist Pliny. Within a month a copy of Darwin’s Origin of Species would arrive in Concord and Thoreau’s own vast natu ral history proj ects would take one last turn” (Life of the Mind, 372–73). Sherman Paul characterizes Thoreau’s late po liti cal essays as moments of weakness in which he proves “insufficiently the hermit,” proposing that Thoreau meant to “flee society” in the 1850s but found it “increasingly distracting him” u ntil it “infected him” with the “need to champion princi ple” (Shores of Amer i ca, 269–70). Sattelmeyer more dispassionately describes this period as one of bifurcation in Thoreau’s output, characterizing his mature “development . . . [as] clearly in the direction of increasing interest in the study and writing about nature on the one hand, and on the other the expression of increasingly sharp and out- spoken views on sensitive social and po liti cal issues of the day” (Thoreau’s Reading, 78). 81.

I am reasonably confident that Thoreau would have had this Latin origin in mind b ecause— besides his well- known predilection for etymology— the eulogy he composed for Brown closes with a translation of Tacitus on Agricola’s death, commending the transmission of Agricola’s spirit and virtues to his immediate posterity (“Martyrdom of John Brown,” in Reform Papers, 139–44). 87.

Indeed, even in its machinic applications— for instance, as the operative mechanism of the telegraph— electricity retained a distinct connection to the occult, producing what critics like Jeffrey Sconce, Richard Menke, and Paul Gilmore have described as the spiritualizing tendencies of mid- century media discourse. For further discussion of the curiously immaterial materiality of nineteenth- century electrical media, see Sconce, Haunted Media; Menke, Telegraphic Realism; and Gilmore, Aesthetic Materialism. 4. John Kucich and Erik Seeman point out that, beyond mesmerism and phrenology, the American Spiritualist movement was also importantly related to a range of earlier traditions of spiritual communication, including Native American spiritualist practices, African conjure and vodun practices, and Western Eu ro pean evangelical practices. See Kucich, Ghostly Commu- nion; and Seeman, “Native Spirits, Shaker Visions.” Similarly, Ann Braude (Radical Spirits) also links Spiritualism to mystical traditions within Chris- tian ity. R. Laurence Moore, however, cautions that “in noting these impor- tant and obvious connections” between Spiritualism and other traditions of religious mysticism, “we risk losing sight of spiritualism’s connections with the dominant cultural values in the nineteenth c entury. Any interpretation of spiritualism’s impact must begin with what has appeared to many as an anomaly. Spiritualism became a self- conscious movement precisely at the time it disassociated itself from occult traditions of secrecy. It appealed not 192 Notes to pages 101–106 to the inward illumination of mystic experience, but to the observable and verifiable objects of empirical science. T here was little new in the spirit manifestations of the 1850s except this militant stance, which proved to be exactly the right position to gain the attention of an age that wanted to believe that its universe operated like an orderly machine” (R. Laurence Moore, In Search of White Crows, 7). 5. American Phrenological Journal (1846) quoted in Mackey, “Phrenologi- cal Whitman.” 6. Dods, Philosophy of Electro- Biology, 103. 7. Ibid., 102. 8.

Phelps’s novel partly echoes this sentiment in its suggestion that those who embrace Spiritualist doctrine are (or become) physiologically more refined and advanced than those who do not. The novel’s most out spoken skeptic of Spiritualism is Deacon Quirk, a working- class white character who is described in phreno- logical terms that mark him as racially inferior. Thus in the midst of a theological argument with Aunt Forceythe, Quirk is described as sporting a “narrow forehead braided tight” as well as an “obstinate face with . . . s tupid, good eyes and animal mouth.” By contrast, Aunt Forceythe is described in this scene as “the white, finely cut w oman, with . . . s erene smile and rapt, saintly eyes,— every inch of her, body and soul, refined not only by birth and training, but by the long nearness of her heart to Christ” (Phelps, Gates Ajar, 86–88). 18.

Spiritualism, and the broader currents of what I refer to as bioelectri- cal bohemia, made its way through Whitman’s New York via traveling demonstrations, lectures, séances, and a steady stream of publications, many of them issued by the Manhattan-b ased phrenological firm, Fowler and Wells. It was through the Fowlers that Whitman was first introduced to phrenology, a related discourse of ner vous embodiment, which he defended as belonging “among the sciences” a fter attending a lecture in 1846 (Whit- man, Brooklyn Daily Ea gle, 2). By 1855, when Fowler and Wells became one of only two known retailers to carry Whitman’s self- published first edition of Leaves of Grass, and 1856, when it brought out Whitman’s second edition on the Fowler and Wells imprint, the firm was an established publishing hub for a variety of progressive movements including mesmerism and Spiritual- ism. Moving in the Fowler and Wells circle, Whitman therefore would have encountered a community of thinkers for whom bioelectricity was under- stood to inaugurate a w hole new metaphysics of the self. Indeed, with its proclamations of the divinity of the body and of the nonfinality of death, Leaves of Grass invokes topoi that would have been readily familiar to readers of Fowler and Wells’s other authors, including Andrew Jackson Davis and “electro- biologist” Reverend John Bovee Dods. For a more comprehensive introduction to Whitman’s exposure to Spiritualist, mesmeric, and phreno- logical ideas, see Reynolds, Walt Whitman’s Amer i ca and Beneath the Ameri- can Re nais sance. 28.

Readers may recall h ere Nott and Gliddon’s pronouncement, likewise borne from their embodied theory of personhood, that “the intellectual man is inseparable from the physical man; and the nature of the one cannot be altered without a corresponding change in the other” (Nott and Gliddon, Types of Mankind, 50). 33.

Douglass and Thoreau would recognize the environmentalist theory of race invoked in Whitman’s suggestion here that “the hereditary counte- nance” that comes down to this poet is itself a product not just of race or bloodline but also of local natu ral historical and cultural conditions. Moreover, they would recognize that this environmentalism furnishes the logic behind Whitman’s conclusion that the sheer diversity of Amer i ca’s landscapes and p eoples promises to make its inhabitants “the race of races”: a kind of racial compendium, born of diversity. But whereas the environmen- talist theory of race imagines this pro cess of physiological adaptation and incorporation to span generations, Whitman’s poet, like a medium in trance, absorbs impressions from his surrounding world and is at once transformed into a channel for t hose forces’ expression. The quasi- messianic status Whitman ascribes to the poet thus stems from his sense of the poet’s peculiar temporality, his untimeliness. More so than his peers, this poet has a talent for reception that allows him to embody the culmination “of old and new”; he is “himself the age transfigured,” a prophetic specimen, as Thoreau might call him, who stands “where the future becomes the pres ent” and “glows a moment on the extremest verge” (Whitman, preface to Leaves (1855), 633 (l. 710); 623–24 (ll. 311–15). 39.

Both Tenney Nathanson and Mark Bauerlein find Whitman’s embodied poetry guilty of magical thinking, and as such of both obfuscating mysticism and anti- intellectualism (Nathanson, Whitman’s Presence; Bauer- lein, Whitman and the American Idiom). Ecocritical readers, by contrast, have tended to commend Whitman’s “mysticism” as a laudably ecopoetical effort to communicate the “unsaid and unsayable” essence of nonhuman being while resisting the anthropocentrism of human language.

Katherine Hayles develops her account of the difference between the conception of information as having a body (as being indissociable from the material specificity of its medium), and the notion that information is distinct from the medium in which it is stored. Hayles tracks t hese alternatives through the development of cyber- netics information theory in the twentieth century, but, as Richard Menke points out, the nineteenth- century discourse of electrical communication also raised this question de cades earlier (Menke, Telegraphic Realism, 75–77). Notes to pages 117–119 195 44. This Whitmanian gloss has found new life in some neuroscientific circles. On the assumption that brain states may be taken to be expressive of mental states, neuroscientists are currently developing technology that proposes to allow us to “read” the thoughts and intentions electrically “expressed” in fMRI scans of the brain. See for instance, Kerri Smith, “Brain Decoding.” 45. Whitman, “Song for Occupations,” in Leaves of Grass (1855), 710 (ll. 1–6). 46. Nathanson, Whitman’s Presence, 2. Like Tenney Nathanson, Mark Bauerlein also finds Whitman’s embodied poetry guilty of magical thinking and hence, Bauerlein argues, of anti- intellectualism (Bauerlein, Whitman and the American Idiom). 47.

Coviello’s analy sis leans on two major earlier queer theoretical readings of Whitman’s conflation of poems and bodies: Michael Warner’s argument that Whitman seeks, thereby, “to make sex public,” and Michael Moon’s suggestion that this is a deliberate fiction designed to light up the discursiveness of bodily and sexual identity more generally, producing a “heightened . . . sense of the constructedness and hence the dense po liti cality of all bodily experience.” See Warner, “Whitman Drunk,” 42; and Moon, Disseminating Whitman, 4. 49.

In suggesting that sensuality may be a more accurate term than sexuality for the generative economy of embodied affinities that Whitman describes, I do not mean to suggest that sensuality and sexuality are mutu- ally exclusive terms. Rather, I suggest that the discourse on sexuality is too narrow a lens for understanding the physics of embodied attachment, indiscriminate affiliation, and self- loss that distinguish the Whitmanian body. To be sure, since Foucault, analyses of sexuality have been careful not to limit our understanding of sexuality to only t hose be hav iors and affective economies explic itly linked to genital sex. But even in its expanded senses, the rubric of sexuality tends to filter back to the prob lem of sexual reproduction by focusing on economies of feeling (as opposed to sensation generally), interpersonal relations (as opposed to both h uman and human- nonhuman relations), object se lection (at the exclusion of involuntary and indiscrimi- nate attachments), questions of identity and typology (as opposed to trans- corporeal contiguity and self- loss), and so forth. As I argue in my discussion 196 Notes to pages 119–123 of “is this then a touch?,” perhaps the most crucial insight to be gained by reading Whitman’s bioelectrical body in light of not just sexuality but sensuality more broadly is that d oing so allows us to recognize his sustained refutation of autonomous identity. In this sense, my reading of Leaves argues more generally for an expanded approach to Whitman’s treatment of embodied affinities. Before Darwin made sexual se lection the prime mover of evolution, and before the field of sexology made sexuality as a defining feature of personal identity, the sensuously impressionable body also appeared—in Spiritualist discourse and environmentalist racial theory alike—to be world- making, diffusing sympathetic attachments including but not limited to those forms of attachment we deem sexual. 54.

As Michaels puts this, “Reports of what something makes us feel are not beliefs about what it means.” This is to say, in other words, “that t here is a logical difference between the effects any work of art actually produces and the effects it was intended to produce and that the interpretation of a work of art has every thing to do with the effects it was intended to produce and nothing whatsoever to do with the effects it in fact produces” (Michaels, “Intention at the College”). 60.

While I share Gilmore’s sense that poetry is, for Whitman, essentially social, I think it is impor tant to stress the paradox implicit in Gilmore’s suggestion that Whitman both urgently wants his poems read and is happy for them “to produce any sort of meaning.” Gilmore thus puts his fin ger on the unortho- doxy of Whitman’s sense of poetry, which at once insists on an audience and yet denies responsibility or even concern for the outcome of that encounter. 68.

Indeed, if we follow Vincent Bertolini’s suggestion that Whitman “convey[s] messages that are enveloped even from his own understanding,” we might well conclude that Whitman’s disavowals of meaning uncannily anticipate Tiffany’s theory of lyric obscurity (Bertolini, “ ‘Hinting’ and ‘Reminding,’ ” 1050, 1053). 75.

Although my reading of the auction in “I Sing the Body Electric” will highlight its antiracist egalitarianism, I do not mean to suggest that Whitman was therefore a committed advocate of antiracism. Instead, my focus on the pro cessual logic from which Whitman’s antiracism derives should indicate that he was a committed advocate of an embodied ontology whose entailments for racial politics he occasionally attempted to specify. Whitman’s pronouncements on racial politics remained variable and somewhat opportunistic in the 1850s; however, his views on the materiality of the body w ere clear and consistent. 80.

The imagery of inhaled perfumes and atmospheres in the ensuing lines invite us to imagine atoms recirculating in and out of the speaker’s body; moreover, as Mark Noble argues, the recombinatory nature of matter is central to the materialist imaginary of the early Leaves. As a defense of demo cratic equality, however, I submit that this empirical claim does not do the work that Whitman asks of it. See Noble, American Poetic Materialism. 88. My reading h ere is partially in agreement with Dimock’s argument in “Whitman, Syntax, and Po liti cal Theory.” T here, Dimock argues that the radical egalitarianism of Whitmanian syntax makes no concessions to the distinctly non- egalitarian logic of affection, which privileges “selec- tive attachment” over “the demo cratic need for substitutability and interchangeability” (72). She concludes, “If nothing e lse, Whitman makes us long for what he does not and cannot offer: an ethics of preference, one that, in giving voice to what is not exhausted by a language of formal univer- sals . . . m ight suggest some way of reconciling the demo cratic and the affective, some way of rescuing ‘love’ from being the lost soul of po liti cal theory” (78). Like Dimock, I find that Whitman’s leveling vision precludes us from making distinctions between entities. On Dimock’s reading, this is a prob lem with the way democracy takes no account of special preference (love—or sexual attraction, for that matter). On my reading, however, the undifferentiability Whitman conjures is a prob lem for democracy: Whitma- nian egalitarianism—an artifact not just of his syntax but of his metaphysical commitments— does not allow us to ontologically distinguish one entity from another, and therefore is not, properly speaking, an egalitarianism at all, since it blurs the individual units in which demo cratic equality trades. For what it’s worth, I do not share Dimock’s sense that love is “the lost soul” of demo cratic politics; on the contrary, my sense is that love’s “ethics of preference” is precisely what demo cratic and l egal formalisms are designed to offset. Justice and demo cratic equality ask us to look beyond the biases of our affective ties ( whether these be ties of kinship, tribe, or race—or ties of ideological consensus) in order to recognize the claims of even those whom we do not know or love.

Materialist feminism and queer theory, for instance, are liberatory scholarly fields that have been engines of posthumanist theorizing. T hese fields have also held impor tant conversations about the tension between their po liti cal and posthumanist commitments (see, for instance, Luciano and Chen, “Has the Queer Ever Been”). There has also been a broader shift back to the body in recent theorizing about race, and impor tant new works reopen the nineteenth- century question of race’s material ontology. See, for instance, Puar, “ ‘ Rather Be a Cyborg’ ”; Saldanha, “Bastard and Mixed- Blood”; Hames- Garcia, “How Real Is Race?”; Wright, Physics of Blackness. Sarah Ahmed also highlights the risk of oversimplifying poststructuralist feminism’s relation to materiality in “Imaginary Prohibitions.” This list suggests that the re sis tance to posthumanist theory has other sources than a distrust of materiality per se. 9.

Sylvia Wynter, as we will see, argues that social justice depends upon reinventing this current genre of “the human.” 13. Colebrook, Death of the Posthuman, 23. Like Colebrook, posthumanist scholars associated with speculative realism and object- oriented ontology prescribe an ontological turn that does not turn to the ontology of human being (for instance, by emphasizing the materiality of the self and embodied nature of knowledge), but that seeks instead to constitute a form of knowledge in de pen- dent of the mediating function of human sensation, perception, and cognition. 14. Bogost, Alien Phenomenology, 4.

This slippage is, for instance, particularly notable in the work of Graham Harman, the architect of OOO. Harman objects to post- Kantian philosophy’s ac cep tance of human finitude not because he faults its logic— not, that is, because he thinks humans do have unmediated perceptual access to real ity— but b ecause he faults its ethics. Harman understands Kant’s circumscription of philosophical knowledge to t hings “as they appear for us” to constitute an ethical vio lence: he describes post- Kantian philosophy as a “Hiroshima of metaphysics” that sets up a “global apartheid” against speculation into real ity as nonhumans experience it (Prince of Networks, 102–3). With this description, then, ontological finitude starts to look like an ethical choice. 16. Moore, “Capitalocene,” 2. 17. Ibid. 18. Povinelli, Geontologies, 32. 19.

See also Weheliye’s critique of biopolitics discourse in Habeas Viscus, and Julia Suarez- Krabbe’s account of the “colonial death proj ect” in Race, Rights, and Rebels. 23. A word on comparisons of racism and speciesism: the divergence between posthumanism’s focus on nonhuman animal life and posthumanist social justice’s focus on dehumanized h uman life is sometimes expressed as a competition over whether racism or speciesism is the primordial instance of the epistemic discrimination that both seek to contest. Thus, for instance, Christopher Peterson suggests that “negative ste reo types about nonhuman animals are the condition of possibility for negative ste reo types about social and po liti cal minorities,” while Jackson contends that “blackness conditions and constitutes the . . . nonhuman” (Peterson, Bestial Traces, 9; Jackson, “Outer Worlds,” 216). The point is that Peterson and Jackson are both right. That is, when we hold onto the recognition that the moral statuses “ human” and “nonhuman” are not synonyms for “Homo sapiens” and “non– Homo sapiens,” it becomes clearer that racism and speciesism are two names for the same ideological operation: the disaggregation of communal being into a typological hierarchy of beings that do, and beings that do not merit moral regard. When I suggest that racism and speciesism are two names for the same ideological operation, I am not arguing that we ought to begin to treat speciesism as a prob lem that is as ethically urgent as racism. More perplex- ingly, I am suggesting that part of the challenge of thinking beyond the humanist episteme is learning to see antiracism and antispeciesism as struc- turally conjoined rather than analogous or even competitive social proj ects. Notes to pages 146–148 201 24. As Weheliye observes, this in turn leads posthumanists to write of the human as if “we have now entered a stage in h uman development where all subjects have been granted equal access to western humanity” (Habeas Viscus, 10). 25. To suggest that posthumanism’s Eurocentric bias is methodologically unsound is not to suggest that identity and episteme have any natu ral or necessary connection. It is not therefore to presume that indigenous, postcolonial, or queer of color perspectives necessarily instantiate exemplary posthumanist epistemologies by virtue of their eccentric vantage from the margins of the hegemonic regime of the human. Thus Weheliye warns that the voices of marginalized peoples “should not be construed as fountains of suffering authenticity” (Habeas Viscus, 82). Nor should t hese voices be construed as univocal: as Kim TallBear writes of indigenous scholars, “We are diverse thinkers” (“Indigenous Perspective,” 230). Conversely, to suggest that posthumanists would benefit from consulting more nonwhite and non- Western thinkers is not to presume that the work of Western- born thinkers is therefore epistemically “Western”: that Deleuze is a white Frenchman does not mean that his ontology must necessarily be complicit with Western humanism. But it is neither reductive nor essentializing to observe that the proj ect of conceptualizing modes of being outside or orthogonal to the discriminatory modern Western praxis of “Man” has been carried forward in minority scholarly studies for de cades, and in non- Western cultural traditions for even longer. As TallBear notes, “indigenous peoples have never forgotten that nonhumans are agential beings engaged in social relations that profoundly shape h uman lives” (234). And therefore, however committed posthumanism is, in theory, to thinking beyond Western “Man,” that commitment w ill continue to seem gestural and incomplete so long as t hese extra- and counterhegemonic cultural and schol- arly traditions remain peripheral to posthumanist work. 26. Wynter gives several accounts of this genealogy, each of which differs slightly. H ere I am most closely following the history she gives in “On How We Mistook,” and in Wynter and McKittrick, “Unparalleled Catastrophe.” See also Wynter, “1492.” 27.

Wynter and McKittrick, “Unparalleled Catastrophe,” 34. The phrase “nonphysical princi ple of causality” is a citation from Christian theologian Keith Ward. The modulation of Wynter’s proj ect I am about to suggest would not apply if she were to follow Ward in believing that h uman being is uniquely ensouled. If sociogeny, for Wynter, is not in fact a speciological trait (i.e., arising from the nature of the body) but rather a trait wholly unrelated to h uman embodiment—if, in short, sociogeny refers to a form of transcen- dent freedom that stems from humanity’s possession of an immaterial soul— then Wynter’s proj ect is dualistic and cannot be combined with posthumanist materialism. However, despite Wynter’s invocation of Ward and of sociogeny’s in de pen dence from m atter, her proj ect seems other wise distinctly nondualist. As I s hall discuss, she shows a recurring interest in the material substrates of sociogeny. 53. Wynter and McKittrick, “Unparalleled Catastrophe,” 34, 29. Notes to pages 157–165 203 54. I am indebted h ere to Colleen Glenney Boggs’s astute reading of this scene, which differs from my own but which first signaled to me the impor- tance of animality to this scene’s critical register.

Indeed, Weheliye argues that Wynter’s work has been overlooked in con temporary biopo liti cal and posthumanist theory precisely because lingering racism in the acad emy has meant that “minority discourses seemingly cannot inhabit the space of proper theoreti- cal reflection” (6). Ultimately, however— and counterintuitively, given the argument I cite here— Weheliye follows Wynter in insisting upon the exceptional freedom of human being. 57. Wynter, “1492,” 47. 58.

Douglass, “Heroic Slave,” 246. 4. Latour, Politics of Nature, 25. 5. Dana Luciano and Mel Chen offer an incisive and illuminating discussion of this tension in “Has the Queer Ever Been H uman?” 6. These examples of posthumanism’s wonderful reor ga ni za tion of po liti cal physics are drawn from Chen, Animacies, and Bennett, Vibrant Matter. Luciano and Chen also suggest that posthumanism might be “a new mode of critical realism,” and I find myself deeply sympathetic to the account that they give (“Has the Queer Ever Been,” 191). It is not my sense, however, that this realism amounts to a historical “recognition that the nature of ‘real ity’ itself is changing as power moves away from the individual” under the conditions of biopo liti cal “control society.” The material realism I find in posthumanism does tend to dwarf the agency of the individual by contextualizing it within the myriad vectors of human and nonhuman power, but this situation— the comparative smallness of individual agency vis- à- vis systemic power—is, on my reading of posthumanism, not an artifact of po liti cal history but of h uman embodiment, the materiality of being as such. 204 Notes to pages 165–169 7. In the “vast clear scheme” of the world, Whitman insists, “ every motion and e very spear of grass and the frames and spirits of men and women and all that concerns them are unspeakably perfect miracles all referring to all and each distinct and in its place.” Whitman, preface to Leaves of Grass (1855), 626 (l. 422). Indeed, Whitman assures us, the perfec- tion of this pro cessual universe is both beautiful, just, and good. “The fruition of beauty is no chance hit or miss . . . i t is inevitable as life. . . . it is as exact and plumb as gravitation” (Whitman, preface to Leaves (1855), 623 (ll. 280–81). The good deeds we do in “the direct lifetime” accrue “onward afterward through the indirect lifetime . . . . The interest will come around” (Whitman, preface to Leaves (1855), 631–33 (ll. 625–86). “Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good, / The whole universe indicates that it is good. . . . W hat is called good is perfect, and what is called sin is just as perfect, / The vegetables and minerals are all perfect . . . and the imponder- able fluids are perfect; / Slowly and surely they have passed on to this, and slowly and surely they w ill yet pass on” (Whitman, “To Think of Time,” in Leaves (1855), 723 (ll.116-24). 8. Douglass, “Fourth of July,” in Selected Speeches and Writings, 204. 9. There are, of course, impor tant exceptions to this tendency within romantic thought, particularly prevalent in certain treatments of the sublime as indicative of the natu ral world’s amoralism and indifference to man. See, for instance, Shelley’s “Mont Blanc” and Thoreau’s “Ktaadn.” 10. Timothy Morton elaborates this reading of romanticism’s normative nature in Ecol ogy without Nature. 11.

Some examples: Karen Barad converts quantum entanglement into a call to responsibility— material relation becomes ethical obligation. Jane Bennett closes Vibrant Matter with a “Nicene Creed” to entangled complex- ity, turning a material condition into an article of not just empirical but moral faith. Or Michelle Wright, embracing a fluid ontology of identity, concludes that if “we are not fixed quantities but ever- shifting qualities,” then “equality . . . is a matter of qualitative connection rather than quantitative sameness”: mutual involvement here becomes equivalent to mutual re spect (Physics of Blackness, 34). 14.

Miller’s The Novel and the Police, the discussion I am thinking of h ere is Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s analy sis of Note to page 170 205 the hermeneutics of suspicion (where she quotes this line from Miller) in Touching Feeling, 139. 19. Caroline Levine raises this possibility in her analy sis of the “affor- dances of form” in literary fiction. In her argument for “broadening our definition of form to include social arrangements,” Levine shows how formalist analy sis can “be as valuable to understanding sociopo liti cal institutions as it is to reading lit er a ture.” Posthumanist materialism can itself be understood as chiefly a shift in form—an attempt to reimagine the world from the perspective of pro cesses and assemblages rather than individuals and identities. In this re spect, we can think of posthumanism as a mode of formal analy sis, and lit er a ture as a particularly rich and rewarding site for developing our attentiveness to the morphology of connectivity (Levine, Forms, 2).
