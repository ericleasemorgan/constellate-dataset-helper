Scott-ish. Although Scott’s novels have plummeted from sight like a large rock to the bottom of a lake, ripples of his medievalese continue to radiate from the dropping point. In my view we owe partly, although ever more obliquely, to Scott the frequency of some odd vocabulary, morphology, and syntax in historical fiction today. On such language (but without consideration of Scott), see Miriam Youngerman Miller, “‘Thy Speech Is Strange and Uncouth’: Language in the Children’s Historical Novel of the Middle Ages,” Children’s Literature 23 (1995): 71–90. impressions of the Middle Ages. The English adjective medieval is first attested in 1817. Although the attestation does not appear in a text composed by Scott, it owes indirectly to the vogue for the period that more than anyone else of his day he helped to instigate in the English-speaking world.

I can almost remember the faith that gave me energy, and the scared boldness that made my towers seem to me so daring, with the bits of gracefulness that I hazarded with some doubts whether the divine grace could properly be shown outside. Within I had no doubts. There the contrite sinner was welcomed with such tenderness as makes me still wish I were one. There is not a stone in the whole interior which I did not treat as though it were my own child. I was not clever, and I made some mistakes which the great men of Amiens corrected. I was simple-minded, somewhat stiff and cold, almost repellant to the warmer natures of the south, and I had lived always where one fought handily and needed to defend one’s wives and children; but I was at my best. Nearly eight hundred years have passed since I made the fatal mistake of going to England, and since then I have never done anything in the world that can begin to compare in the perfection of its spirit and art with my cathedral of Coutances.

The mention of an attic 320 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 3 is captivating, since it fuses the idea of a cloistered medieval brother with the romantic stereotype of the indigent artist in a garret. The cloister still occupied Adams’s mind a year later in the spring of 1901. When acknowledging receipt of a book by Henry Osborn Taylor, he presented himself as suffering from lassitude and needing cloistered tranquility. Thinking himself alone in this condition, he professed surprise to discover from reading his former colleague’s volume that Taylor too was even more deeply versed in the same Middle Ages that obsessed him. Letter to Henry Osborn Taylor, May 4, 1901, in LHA, 5: 247–48, at 247: “[I] only returned [to the Middle Ages], at last, because I was tired, and wanted quiet and solitude and absorption.

Clover was also present symbolically within the façade of Romanesque revival home that Henry Hobson Richardson built for them. Not long before her suicide at the age of forty-two, she appears to have sided with the architect and against her spouse by having installed in the front of the house a stone carving of a lion that had above it a cross. For reasons we can only guess, Adams was harrowed by something about the notion of this symbolism. See Friedrich, Clover, 316–17.

Neither Saint-Gaudens nor Adams left any reference to “The Sacrifice of Iphigeneia at Aulis” from Pompeii that survives from the first half of the first century CE. The ancient Roman fresco may be based in turn, at least in part, on a lost original by the Greek painter Timanthes of Cythnos from the fourth century BCE (see Fig. n.5). The wall painting depicts a scene from the body of myths that relate to the Trojan War. To the right the princess of Argos is being dragged off for sacrifice to Artemis, with to the far right either the seer Calchas or her father, King Agamemnon. To the far left stands a mantled shape, either her grieving mother Clytemnestra or her father.

In the twelfth century we have William of Malmesbury’s Gesta regum (Deeds of the Kings) and Henry of Huntingdon’s Historia Anglorum (History of the English).

Adams, EHA, chap. 29, “The Abyss of Ignorance (1902),” 1117: “Eight or ten years of study had led Adams to think he might use the century 1150–1250, expressed in Amiens Cathedral and the Works of Thomas Aquinas, as the unit from which he might measure motion down to his own time, without assuming anything as true or untrue except relation. The movement might be studied at once in philosophy and mechanics. Setting himself to the task, he began a volume which he mentally knew as ‘Mont Saint Michel and Chartres: a study of thirteenth-century unity.’ From that point he proposed to fix a position for himself, which he could label: ‘The Education of Henry Adams: a study of twentieth-century multiplicity.’ With the help of these two points of relation, he hoped to project his lines forward and backward indefinitely, subject to correction from anyone who should know better.” The passage gains additional force from being quoted in the opening “Editor’s Preface” in the Library of America edition, p. 719. recoil from an ‘over civilized’ modern existence.

These essays were based on Zukofsky’s master’s thesis on Adams. (When they were reprinted later, this passage was not included: see Zukofsky, Prepositions, 86–130.) Zukofsky continued to engage with Adams after his thesis, as in “William Carlos Williams” (1928), in Prepositions, 45–53, at 51–52. The poet drew heavily on Adams in his poem “A,” although less in subsequent than in the original plans. On the original and subsequent plans for the tenth part of the original “A,” see Barry Ahearn, Zukofsky’s “A”: An Introduction (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1983), 77–78.

Henry Adams, Letter to Brooks Adams, September 8, 1895, in LHA, 4: 321–22: “The Gothic always looks to me a little theatrical and false, like its roofs. The Gothic church, both in doctrine and in expression, is not my idea of a thoroughly happy illusion. It is always restless, grasping and speculative; it exploits the world, and makes profits; it is the legitimate parent of Lombard Street; the legitimate child of the Jews. The pointed arch is cheap. Still, it had very great beauties in its best time, and, as an artistic form of illusion, it gives me a sense of reflecting my own ideals and limitations. It is human.” fuller telling.

To some of us when we first read it, now many years ago, it seemed to point out a new road on which the world should travel. And in spite of all the disappointments of forty years, and although some of us, John Ruskin amongst others, have since learned what the equipment for that journey must be, and how many things must be changed before we are equipped, yet we can still see no other way out of the folly and degradation of Civilization. For the lesson which Ruskin here teaches us is that art is the expression of man’s pleasure in labour; that it is possible for man to rejoice in his work, for, strange as it may seem to us to-day, there have been times when he did rejoice in it; and lastly, that unless man’s work once again becomes a pleasure to him, the token of which change will be that beauty is once again a natural and necessary accompaniment of productive labour, all but the worthless must toil in pain, and therefore live in pain.” 346 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 3 A History of the Gothic Revival.

Even the schools which were not Gothic foundations insisted on confining themselves in Gothically-revived cells, as the hermit crab seeks for a twisted shell in which to case itself.” The criticism may be leveled at more than just English Baroque architecture, known in Britain as Queen Anne style, or the early twentieth-century recrudescence of it in the Queen Anne revival: the invocation of Anne in which may be misogynist.

Charles Eliot Norton, Notes of Travel and Study in Italy (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, 1859), 102–3: “The building of cathedrals is, in truth, one of the main features of the social history of Europe during the Middle Ages. In England, in Spain, in France, in the Low Countries, in Germany, in Italy, in Sicily, these magnificent monuments of genius and devotion rose in rapid succession during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. By a great impulse of popular energy, by a long combination of popular effort with trained skill, cathedrals, each requiring almost the revenues of a kingdom for its construction, sprang up from the soil in the hearts of scores of rival cities. There have been no works of architecture in later times comparable with them in grandeur of design, in elaborateness of detail, in that broad unity of conception Notes to Chapter 4 – The Knight Errant and Copeland & Day 357 which, while leaving the largest scope for the play of fancy the exercise of special ability by every workman, subordinated the multifarious differences of parts into one harmonious whole.

He lighted upon the French monastery without premeditation, not driven by any apparent knowledge of our tale. His resolve to throw into relief both the mission and the construction style favored by medieval Cistercians (particularly those of Clairvaux) helps to explain why the faculty and students of American colleges in this period demonstrated such receptivity to the stories of Our Lady’s Tumbler and the Le jongleur de Notre Dame. round-arch.

Everyone knew that the Cologne cathedral had been completed 370 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 3 in the nineteenth century, but how many could identify exactly which elements were modern, and which medieval? The same holds for the Ulm Minster, construction of which began in the Gothic era but was not completed until the late nineteenth century (see Figs. n.14 and n.15). It boasts the tallest steeple in the world, now aged all of 125 years, barely older than Cram’s contributions to the architecture of West Point.

The Romanesque revival is sometimes referred to alternatively as the “Norman style” or “Lombard style,” particularly in works published during the nineteenth century. These alternative names refer to variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards, respectively. Thus, the University of California at Los Angeles is dominated by magnificent edifices in Lombard Romanesque revival, such as Royce Hall, the Chemistry Building (see Fig. n.16), or, facing them, the library with its splendidly vaulted reading room (see Figs. n.17 and n.18).

The showiest, which is not to say beloved or successful, is Alexander Hall (see Fig. n.22).

At the same time, the medievalism of the hall is American to the utmost. Despite not having been designed by Richardson himself but by William A.

Evening after evening the senior singing had drifted over the campus in melancholy beauty, and through the shell of his undergraduate consciousness had broken a deep and reverent devotion to the gray walls and Gothic peaks and all they symbolized as warehouses of dead ages. The tower that in view of his window sprang upward, grew into a spire, yearning higher until its uppermost tip was half invisible against the morning skies, gave him Notes to Chapter 5 – F.

He liked knowing that Gothic architecture, with its upward trend, was peculiarly appropriate to universities, and the idea became personal to him.

We have Adams’s viewpoint on the meeting, which took place through Cyril Sigourney Webster Fay, an Episcopalian minister who converted to Roman Catholicism in 1908 and became a priest in 1910. Fay was a trustee of the Newman School, a Catholic preparatory school on the corner of Essex Street and Polifly Road in Hackensack, New Jersey, which Fitzgerald attended as a boarder from 1911 to 1913. In November of 1912, the future writer became acquainted with Fay (see Fig. n.28). Fay’s death in the influenza epidemic of 1919 shook Fitzgerald profoundly as he was composing his first novel. The man of the cloth appeared in This Side of Paradise as the dramatis persona Monsignor Thayer Darcy. In addition, he was the dedicatee of the book. Finally, his letters to the novelist were quarried by the writer when he composed the story.

From 1849 to 1907, it occupied the Free Academy Building in downtown Manhattan, a Gothic revival structure designed by James Renwick Jr. that was demolished in 1928. In 1907, the institution moved to a George Browne Post-designed collegiate Gothic campus in Manhattanville, upper Manhattan (see Figs. n.32, n.33 and n.34). Not to be confused with City College is the University of the City of New York, which in time would become New York University (see Fig. n.35). Its University Building, designed by the architectural firm of Ithiel Town, Alexander Jackson Davis, and James Dakin, was built in 1833–1836 but razed in 1894–1895. Davis had the decisive hand in the design of the chapel inside the building. Samuel F. B.

The Evanston campus features various substantially later constructions in collegiate Gothic. Dedicated in 1933, the Charles Deering Library was the inspiration of James Gamble Rogers, a graduate of Yale University (see Fig. n.36). In writing of his intentions in Illinois, the architect referred very openly to his desire “to make a distinctive style of elastic Gothic architecture that will be ‘Northwestern Gothic.’” James Gamble Rogers to Willliam A. Dyche, October 9, 1930, Minutes of the Board of Trustees, October 28, 1930, Northwestern University Archives, quoted by Betsky, James Gamble Rogers, 57. His architectural palette was expansive, with Gothic being only one among many traditional colors among which he alternated with a quietly impressive eclecticism. Also conceived by him at the same university was the much less labyrinthine Lutkin Memorial Hall, completed in 1941 (see Fig. n.37), the South Quadrangle, Scott Hall, and the stadium on the Evanston campus.

The Proposed Graduate College of Princeton (Princeton, NJ: Printed for the University, 1903), 15: “Whatever may be true of other subjects, liberal studies at least find their greatest charm amid old associations and their natural home in the peace of rural life. Quadrangles enclosing sunny lawns, towers and gateways opening into quiet retreats, ivy-grown walls looking on sheltered gardens, vistas through avenues of arching elms, walks that wind amid the groves of Academe,—these are the places where the affections linger and where memories cling like the ivies themselves, and these are the answers in architecture and scenic setting to the immemorial longings of academic generations back to the time when universities first began to build their homes. Nothing so deeply appeals to our students to-day as this type of architecture,— the exquisite collegiate Gothic, found at its best in the remaining examples of Oxford and Cambridge. Nothing so fully accords in spirit with our desires for Princeton.” West used very similar language a decade later in The Graduate College at Princeton, with Some Reflections on the Humanizing of Learning (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1913). gardens of the mind. “The Spirit of Learning,” delivered before the Harvard Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa on July 1, 1909, Harvard Graduate’s Magazine (September 1909): 1–17.

No one can walk in a road cut through pine woods, without being struck with the architectural appearance of the grove, especially in winter, when the bareness of all other trees shows the low arch of the Saxons. In the woods in a winter afternoon one will see as readily the origin of the stained-glass window with which the Gothic cathedrals are adorned, in the colours of the western sky seen through the bare and crossing branches of the forest. Nor can any lover of nature enter the old piles of Oxford and the English cathedrals without feeling that the forest overpowered the mind of the builder, and that his chisel, his saw, and plane, still reproduced its ferns, its spikes of flowers, its locust, its pine, its oak, its fir, its spruce.” closely related.

For instance, the Frenchman Huysmans explained, “It is almost certain for me that man found in the woods the aspect so often discussed of naves and the ogive.” For this quotation in French (from La cathédrale) within a broad discussion of the analogy, see Joëlle Prungnaud, Figures littéraires de la cathédrale: 1880–1918 (Villeneuve d’Ascq, France: Presses universitaires du Septentrion, 2008), 145. Others would have simply seen the parallel, without forcing the two sides of it into conformity with the principle of cause and effect (see Fig. n.38). Beyond trees, people in the late nineteenth century saw in Gothic finials and quatrefoils a transference from horticulture, specifically the thistle and clover.

He presented Mount Washburn in Yellowstone National Park as “spired and turreted like Gothic cathedrals.” In his mind, the towering rocks and stones of the landscape and the jutting trees of the forests fulfilled in the United States the same functions as sacred sanctuaries in the Old World.

In 1872, Clarence King wrote of the Sierra Nevada, “the whole mountains shaped themselves like the ruins of cathedrals,—sharp roof-ridges, pinnacled and statued; buttresses more spired and ornamented than Milan’s; receding 394 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 3 doorways with pointed arches carved into black façades of granite, doors never to be opened, innumerable jutting points, with here and there a single cruciform peak, its frozen roof and granite spires so strikingly Gothic I cannot doubt that the Alps furnished the models for early cathedrals of that order.” Clarence King, Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada (Boston: J. R. Osgood, 1872), 99. My attention was drawn to this passage by Sandweiss, Passing Strange, 40–41. Cathedral Rocks and Spires. The name Cathedral Rock was employed for rock formations in La Jolla, California; Acadia National Park, Mt. Desert Island, Bar Harbor, Maine; Pigeon Cove (Rockport), Massachusetts; Bad Lands, Montana; and Ausable Chasm and Genesee Gorge (Letchworth Park, Rochester), New York. Cathedral Spires was also attested in Custer State Park, South Dakota. Yoho National Park in British Columbia, on the western slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains, has a crest called Cathedral Mountain or Cathedral Peak (see Fig. n.39), and by a similar associative chain, the pinnacles of one summit in Colorado gave it the name of Gothic Mountain, which in turn spawned what has devolved into the ghost town of Gothic.

Likewise inspired by these giants, the American writer Bret Harte marveled, in an ode on a cone, at the age and grandeur of the big tree from which it came: “He saw the age of sacred trees, / And Druid groves and mystic larches; / And saw from forest domes like these / The builder bring his Gothic arches.” In this spirit, we find postcards from the early twentieth century Notes to Chapter 5 – Trees as Nature’s Cathedrals 395 celebrating the “world’s largest redwood: Cathedral Tree” in the “Trees of Mystery Park” on the Redwood Highway, California (see Figs. n.40 and n.41). The oversized plant acquired this name from its columnar appearance. Effectively, it comprises nine close-set trees that spring from the roots of a single mother. Still more suggestive is a card depicting a couple, appropriately in their Sunday best, seated as if on the pews of the “Cathedral Group, Big Tree Grove, near Santa Cruz, CA.” (See Figs . n.42 and n.43) When Muir was honored by having Muir Woods National Monument named after him, it was all but foreordained that one stand of such red giants would become known as Cathedral Grove (see Fig. n.44).

Already in 1858, Henry David Thoreau wrote in his Journal of “the quiet and somewhat sombre aisles of a forest cathedral.” Henry David Thoreau, Journal, ed. Bradford Torrey and Francis H. Allen, 2 vols. (New York: Dover, 1962), 2: 1402 (11: 353), cited by Giblett, People and Places, 143. Elsewhere, he made the same analogy come alive in a way that pitted the New World explicitly against the Old, putting the pines of New England on a par with the haute couture of Paris by drawing a comparison between the patterns imprinted upon the trees by winter with “the designs and ciphers of books of heraldry.” Finally, he laid out a similitude to connect the arboreal with the architectural: “You glance up these paths, closely imbowered by bent trees, as though through the side aisles of a cathedral, and expect to hear a choir chanting from their depths.” January 30, 1841, in Journal, 1: 64 (ed. Torrey and Allen, 1: 184–85). 398 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 3 My Cathedral. The sonnet is part of a poetry collection: see Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ultima Thule (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, 1880), 51–52. Already decades earlier, the writer formulated the analogy between elms and architectural features of churches, presumably Gothic: see Longfellow’s journal entry of December 12, 1849, in idem, The Works of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, 14 vols. (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, 1891), 13: 164. Although not necessarily owing to his direct influence, the place-name Cathedral Pines has been used repeatedly since the late nineteenth century as an unhedging descriptor for camps, campgrounds, nature reserves, vacation developments, and other such locales (see Fig. n.45), as, for instance, in Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, and Wisconsin. From roughly the same time, and from the same analogizing reflex, is the site known as Cathedral Oaks in New Smyrna, Florida. The wide-set oak trees have upper branches, clad in Spanish moss, which curve to meet in a close canopy like a nave (see Fig. n.46). Such comparisons did not occur to the purveyors of postcards alone. For example, we find a 1906 description that correlates the rose window in the cathedral of Bourges with a star as it appears “at the end of an alley of trees.” Arthur Symons, “Cathedrals,” in idem, Studies in Seven Arts (New York: E. P. Dutton, 1906), 151–72, at 170. Nor was it restricted to the United States: in 1921, an artist in New Zealand by the name of Charles Blomfield produced an oil painting entitled The Vaulted Aisles of Nature’s Cathedral that focuses upon the same similarity (see Fig. n.47).

Oliver Wendell Holmes expressed this aspect of elms beautifully in his novel, Elsie Venner: A Romance of Destiny (chap. 5, “An Old-Fashioned Descriptive Chapter”: “No natural Gothic arch compares, for a moment, with that formed by two American elms...”). See Thomas J. Campanella, Republic of Shade: New England and the American Elm (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2003), 133–38, at 136.

Derby, 1855), https://catalog. hathitrust.org/Record/009578959, 129–36, at 133: “We had rather walk beneath an avenue of elms than inspect the noblest cathedral that art ever accomplished.” The quotation, but not this citation, appears in Campanella, Republic of Shade, 136n49. it had in these plants their arboreal equivalents. Nehemiah Adams, a distant relative of Henry Adams, noted of the specimens on Boston Common “a perspective view of them gives as good a representation of Gothic architecture as man ever copied. A traveler might almost fancy himself again in York cathedral.” Nehemiah Adams, The Boston Common, or, Rural Walks in Cities by a Friend of Improvement (Boston: G. W. Light, 1838), https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008890658, 14–15. Likewise, upon inspecting a park in London, Nathaniel Hawthorne drew a likeness between Old and New World elms that worked much to the disfavor of the English ones, specifically because “Our trees, ‘high over-arched, with echoing walks between,’ have the greater resemblance to the Gothic aisle of a cathedral.” Nathaniel Hawthorne, The English Notebooks, Based upon the Original Manuscripts in the Pierpont Morgan Library, ed. Randall Stewart, repr. (New York: Russell and Russell, 1962), 390. The passage quotes a line from John Milton’s Paradise Lost (book 9: 1107). Traveling in the opposite direction, Charles Dickens visited New Haven on a trip to North America in 1842. He extolled the municipality in Connecticut for the canopy of mature trees that arose from its public tree planting. (The shady deal that the city planners struck gave the place the nickname “The Elm City.”) Admiring the tree-lined and -shaded streets, he observed how the rows helped an urban setting retain small-town atmosphere and beauty, while also connecting the United States to his home country: “the effect is very like that of an old cathedral yard in England; and when their branches are in full leaf, must be extremely picturesque.” Charles Dickens, American Notes for General Circulation, chap. 5, “Worcester. The Connecticut River. Hartford. New Haven. To New York,” in idem, Works, Gadshill edition, 38 vols. (London: Chapman and Hall, 1897–1908), 28: 90. Another Briton at the end of the nineteenth century saw in the tree-lined avenues of the city in Connecticut “Gothic aisles of rich green and sunlit interlacing bows. William Smith, A Yorkshireman’s Trip to the United States and Canada (London: Longman’s, Green, 1892), 151. This passage is quoted and cited in Campanella, Republic of Shade, 137.

Hamlin, “Recent American College Architecture,” The Outlook, August 1, 1903: 791–99, at 799: “These buildings represent an enormous financial investment; and it must be remembered that this physical growth means also a great increase in expenditure for maintenance and administration. All this is significant of the disposition of the American people to increase their financial investment in the higher education—an investment not only in buildings, which, taken alone, might mean mere luxury, but in all that for which the buildings stand, and to promote which they were built—science, literature, religion, and intellectual culture of every kind. The American scholar may well point to these edifices with pride, assured that a hundred years from now many will still be looked upon with admiration, as monuments of the intellectual and artistic enthusiasm of an age too often accounted as wholly given up to a selfish materialism.” 402 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 3 larger donations.

Ray Stannard Baker, Woodrow Wilson; Life and Letters, 8 vols. (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, Page, 1927–1939), 2: 129–212 (“President of Princeton University”), at 174: “By the very simple device of building our new buildings in the Tudor Gothic style we seem to have added a thousand years to the history of Princeton, by merely putting those lines in our buildings which point every man’s imagination to the historical traditions of learning in the English-speaking race. We have declared and acknowledged our derivation and lineage; we have said, ‘This is the spirit in which we have been bred,’ and as the imagination, as the recollection of classes yet to be graduated from Princeton are affected by the suggestions of that architecture, we shall find the past of this country married with the past of the world and shall know with what destiny we have come into the forefront of nations.” Baker quotes from The Public Papers of Woodrow Wilson, 2 vols.

Upon visiting the neo-Gothic extravaganza of Görlitz palace in 1799, Charles-Joseph, the seventh Prince de Ligne, observed: “Never has there been anything as accomplished, never anything that has been executed so well; everything here is so thorough that one believes oneself to be three hundred years younger.” See David M.

More stridently, Cram, never renowned for his moderation, admitted that when swayed by “the subtle obsession of the ivied Old World, the call of inextinguishable race-memory enters in and blots out reason and analysis.” “The Work of Messrs. Cope & Stewardson,” Architectural Record 16 (November 1904): 407–38, at 411. Still, note the imperative in his following sentence: “Shake off the dream, for it betrays judgment.” Yes, Cram took his offering of panegyric for the architecture of Cope and Stewardson as the occasion for analogizing their designs with “indestructible race fealty” and “religious continuity” Notes to Chapter 5 – Collegiate Gothic Havens 403 (p. 413). Yet once again, he qualified his pronouncement. In doing so, he undercut at least a little what the subsequent history of racism both inside and outside academic settings in the United States might lead us to find irredeemably sinister in his avowal. construction techniques. Clark, “Ralph Adams Cram.” Two passages are particularly relevant. First, Cram, Ministry of Art, https://archive.org/details/ministryofart00cram, 208–9: “We do, indeed, indulge in skeleton construction and reinforced concrete and other structural expedients and substitutes, but deep in our racial consciousness, as in that of all other Anglo-Saxon peoples, is the solid conviction that, after all, there are but three real things in the world,—the home, the school and the Church,—and when we are dealing with eternal verities, honest and enduring construction is alone advisable.” Second, Cram, Church Building: A Study of the Principles of Architecture in their Relation to the Church (Boston: Small, Maynard & Co. 1901), https://archive.org/ details/churchbuildinga03cramgoog, 190–91: “The English [Gothic] is ours; for we two are one people, with one history and one blood. I do not mean that we must be imitative or archaeological. We may take what we will from France or Spain or Flanders; but let us apply it all to the English root, so creating a thing that is racial and—our own.” exclusion of the unlike. The medieval architecture is not what drove the emergence of quotas on the admission of Jewish applicants or of outright bans against African- Americans. For succinct treatment, see Alex Duke, Importing Oxbridge: English Residential Colleges and American Universities (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1996), 92–93. For more details, see Marcia Graham Synnott, The Half-Opened Door: Discrimination and Admissions at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, 1900–1970, Contributions in American History, vol. 80 (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1979). For example, Woodrow Wilson supported what was for the time (and for him, in view of his many unprepossessing prejudices) an open policy in the consideration of applicants for admission. He backed collegiate Gothic as strongly as did his opponents at Princeton University in this regard. Even so, the wistfulness for the imagined races that once inhabited England and Normandy could have justified the shutting out of many minorities whose religions, cultures, and physical appearance failed to fit the romanticized and restrictive norm. At their best. Less happily, the support could take an illiberal bent, which an architect such as Ralph Adams Cram would have only rallied. His utopian spouting, Walled Towns (Boston: Marshall Jones, 1919), https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001595080, is a polemic about civilization far more than merely about architecture, and it has been styled “nothing less than a manifesto for neo-medievalist society.” For the quotation, see Matthews, Medievalism, 100. Although not directly, the book is related to his definition of a university as a “walled city against materialism.” 404 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 3 Ivy League and Ivory Tower ivory towers. The metaphor goes back to a verse in the Song of Songs (also known as the Canticle of Canticles or Song of Solomon, 7:4) in which the bridegroom assures the bride that her neck is “as an ivory tower.” Biblical exegetes took the bride to be the Church. Eventually, the likeness was applied by Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve to his friend Alfred de Vigny. Theodore Ziolkowski, The View from the Tower: Origins of an Antimodernist Image (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1998), 29–31. In contradistinction, the real world. This point hardly needs belaboring, but confirmation of the stock opposition between the ivory tower and the real world can be found for instance in the title of H. Douglas Brown, “From Ivory Tower to Real World: A Search for Relevance,” Georgetown University Roundtable in Languages and Linguistics (GURT ’83) (1983): 53–59. Gothic tower. The most influential early exemplar may have been the double dormitory of Pembroke Hall at Bryn Mawr in 1894 (see Fig. n.48), soon corseted in ivy as if it had been in place for centuries. This building had reprises in both Blair Hall at Princeton University, built in 1897, and Brookings Hall at Washington University in Saint Louis, from 1900 to 1902 (see Fig. n.49).

Within the nationalism of the times, the Old Glory in these cards semaphores the all-important matter of the country in which the building is located. iconic status. To indicate that the university had become a truly bicameral institution with an undergraduate college and a graduate school, the cover of the Princeton Alumni Weekly morphed.

The frou-frou Carpenter Gothic of the First Parish Church was scoured away as an undesired excrescence in 1915. At that crossroad, the edifice, not formally part of the university but relied upon heavily by it in the nineteenth century, was remade as if it had been Colonial from its inception. The deliberate architectonic mimicry of the original Cambridge in England that had been foregrounded in Gore Hall was razed, without a backward glance, to make way for the Beaux Arts design of Widener Library. The medievalesque Appleton Chapel was torn down for the present Memorial Church, in Georgian revival. well removed geographically. Andover Hall stands nearer the neighboring town of Somerville than Harvard Square or Yard. The design for the building was widely disseminated already by 1903. Construction was completed in 1911. Its architects, Francis R. Allen and Charles Collens, designed in Gothic revival style The Cloisters as well as the Union Theological Seminary in New York City (see Fig. n.51), and the Thompson Memorial Library at Vassar College (see Fig. n.52).

The two shared the campus for eighteen years, until the merger was nullified by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in 1931. At that juncture, the hulking collegiate Gothic structure remained the possession of the Harvard Divinity School, while the original seminary joined in a new affiliation that enabled a move of its students to the western suburb of Newton. The story of the union, disunion, and federation is recounted in Henry K. Rowe, History of Andover Theological Seminary (Newton, MA: Thomas Todd Printers, 1933), https://archive.org/ details/historyofandover00rowe, 200–5. 408 The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity: Volume 3 Andover Hall echoes, if only loosely, the earlier Gothic erections constructed between 1866 and 1871 at the nearby Episcopal Theological Seminary, whose architects were Ware and Van Brunt. The collegiate Gothic design can and has been faulted, but at least its spiritual associations have helped to cushion the Divinity School from the fates that befell earlier buildings in other styles at Harvard for the study of theology: the former library became the herbarium, while the old Divinity Hall became dormitories.

Three examples would be Cleveland Tower at Princeton, constructed from 1913 to 1917; Harkness Tower at Yale, from 1917 to 1921 (see Fig. n.54); and Chapel Tower at Duke, from 1930 to 1935. The 216-foot Harkness, despite having a steel-and-concrete frame, looks like pure masonry. Its exterior stone was designed by James Gamble Rogers in part to replicate the couronne or “crown” fashion of English Perpendicular Gothic, particularly as articulated in Boston Stump, the tower of the parish church of Saint Botolph in Boston, England. It also betrays the influence of Rouen Cathedral’s Tour de beurre or “Butter Tower.” A final tower not to be omitted is at West Point. The 180-foot projection of Taylor Hall—also called at various points Post Headquarters, Administration Building, and Building 600 (see Fig. n.55)—completed in 1910 by Cram, Goodhue, and Ferguson, has been misrepresented as the highest all-stone masonry edifice in the world.

Eventually, the Gothic cylinder was bound to become animate and to shimmy free from the monopoly of universities—to wriggle away from the gravitational pull of the ivory. In 1929, the Philadelphia architect Milton B. Medary designed a campanile in a site in central Florida due east of Tampa that was intended to bring home the close relationship between the architecture and landscape. The tracery of its lancets exactly copies native trees, while the pinnacles above taper into birds found locally (see Figs. n.56 and n.57). To round off the sense of unity with the environment, the Bok Singing Tower is located beside Lake Wales, in a sanctuary planned by none other than the great landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. For all that, the sylvan setting was not the only direction in which collegiate Gothic could be taken.

The interior of the structure shows the same guidance of the canons of conspicuous waste and predatory exploit.

Barr Jr., founder of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, curated there an exhibition on modern architecture that led to the popularization—in a book co-authored by his fellow Harvard graduate student, Philip Johnson—of the architectural concept “International Style.” Barr had coined the architectural term on the basis of the International Style of Gothic art, to which he had been exposed in 1920 as a Princeton undergraduate in a course with Charles Rufus Morey. See “Barr, Alfred H[amilton], Jr.,” in Dictionary of Art Historians, at www. dictionaryofarthistorians.org/barra.htm; Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson, The International Style: Architecture since 1922 (New York: W. W. Norton, 1932). In 1936, the art historian Nikolaus Pevsner articulated the contributions that architects of the Gothic revival had made to the development of avant-garde styles, and on account of this argument he entitled his book Pioneers of the Modern Movement from William Morris to Walter Gropius (London: Faber & Faber, 1936). a rousing oration. Cram, “Recent University Architecture,” 518: “We have not now, nor have had for three centuries, a civilisation that demanded or could create such artistic expression, but the light is already on the edges of the high hills, and we know Notes to Chapter 6 – World War I and Modernism 423 that a new dawn is at hand. In the meantime, like the monks in the dim monasteries of the Dark Ages, we cherish and conserve all that was great in our greatest past, building as well as we may new Oxfords and new Westminster Abbeys, new Lincolns, new Richmond Castles, new Haddon Halls, not as the last new word in architectural expression, but as schoolmasters and as prophets, content with the educational work we are accomplishing, leaving to our successors the equal but not more honourable task of voicing in novel and adequate form the new civilisation we are helping to create.” Schuyler. To describe the architecture of Yale, the critic quotes from Matthew Arnold a famous phrase on the oldest university town in England: “How enviable the man who has availed himself of the opportunity to recall, in bustling New Haven, the charm of ‘that sweet city with her dreaming spires’ of Oxford.” See Montgomery Schuyler, “Architecture of American Colleges.

Norman Bel Geddes, A Project for a Theatrical Presentation of the Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri, foreword Max Reinhardt, photography Francis Bruguière (New York: Theatre Arts, Inc., 1924): “Norman-Bel Geddes has those qualities which I most cherish in Americans: the inborn power, the natural pride, the child-like delight, essential to begin everything at the beginning, to discover the world anew, and with clear comprehension to establish himself practically in it. He builds castles in the air but he lays their foundations solidly in the ground. He drafts the plan, he places the bricks, and himself mixes the mortar. He is at once a visionary and an organizer. His love for the theatre is fortunate, it is sensuous and fruitful. In the middle ages he would have built cathedrals and made of them the cradle of our theatre.” Victor Hugo’s Notre-Dame de Paris.

See Wright as quoted by Hannah Heidi Levy, Famous Wisconsin Artists and Architects (Oregon, WI: Badger Books, 2004), 262: “Classicism is a mask and does not reflect transition.
