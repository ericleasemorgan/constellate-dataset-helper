WALDEN. By Henry David Thoreau. Merrill's Eng- lish Texts. Edited and annotated by J. Milnor Dorey. New York: Charles E. Merrill Company. Cloth. 435 dp. Price, 50 cents. The universal reading of Thoreau is most aestraoie. Attractive as are the writings of several later American lovers of nature, Thoreau remains our one distinct mas- ter While the charm in his writings is in the style of expression, in the turn of his thought and in the spirit of his life with nature, there is beyond all Â«these the fact that he needed no botanical manual, no microscope, no railroad ticket or saddle horse in order to learn all that nature taught him, and the tendency of his books is to develop this qloseness to nature on the part of his dis- ciples.
