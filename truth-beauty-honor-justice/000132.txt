chapter 6 Asatru – A Religion of Nature? Critiques of monotheism, the promotion of polytheism, and the related dis- course on Nordic myth frequently work on the assumption that polytheism, and thus Paganism, is closer to nature and more conducive to ecological ideals than monotheisms. In comparison, monotheism and/or Christianity are seen as inimical to both natural human drives and to the natural environment. Such ideas can be traced back to theories of Germanic or Indo-European religion as fertility cults with a more intimate relation to nature than ‘desert religions,’ which allegedly originate in arid, infertile climates. These theories intersected with Romanticism’s revaluation of nature as a metaphor for the primordial, unspoiled, and pure.1 They were taken up positively in the primitivist neo- Romantic currents around 1900, which in turn inspired new, alternative reli- gions. Since then, ideas about a Pagan and Nordic nature spirituality have developed a remarkable productivity. They have influenced Western percep- tions of nature and the natural within ecological and new spiritual movements and beyond. This is evident in the fact that many people today experience nature as a realm for spiritual, or at least uplifting, experiences. Equally widespread is the idea that Christianity or monotheism, with its mandate to ‘subdue the earth,’ is responsible for the destruction of the natural environment, whereas Paganism sees nature as animated, and thus supposedly treats it with more respect. Over the last few decades, environmentalism and environmental spiritual- ity have enjoyed a reputation as being progressive. Therefore, the widespread self-understanding of Asatru as a ‘religion of nature’ is much less controversial than the issues of ethnicity and concepts of religion with which it intersects. This identification with nature religion has contributed to a more general acceptance of Asatru in the 1970s and 80s. Since then, Heathenism as a r eligion 1 Steven Sutcliffe, “Between Apocalypse and Self-realisation. ‘Nature’ as an Index of New Age Religiosity,” in Nature Religion Today. Paganism in the Modern World, ed. Joanne Pearson, Richard H. Roberts, and Geoffrey Samuel (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), 33, reminds us that the concepts of nature active in New Age and Neopagan thought today go back to the 17th and 18th century. Here, nature was conceptualized as “the material world itself,” but also personified as a “singular nature,” as in “mother nature,” on the one hand. On the other hand, it was used for specific locations, such as the countryside, unspoiled places, plants, and creatures other than man. Thus, it came to occupy an oppositional place to cul- ture and was identified with the primordial and authentic. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi �0.��63/97890043095�7_008 This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution- NonCommercial 3.0.

At the same time, some of the underlying concepts of an animated nature and of nature spirituality are fraught with an intellectual heritage going back to Social Darwinist, racist, and völkisch traditions. Investigating the rela- tionship between nature and spirituality in Asatru and in general discourse can therefore shed light on the problems and ambivalences of nature-spiritual traditions within ecological movements, while explaining much about Asatru’s successful alignment with respectable and powerful new social movements. Nature Spirituality in Asatru The 1970s and 80s, the years of contemporary Asatru’s inception, coincide with the early heyday of the environmental movement. It is thus no surprise that Asatruers worldwide already then highlighted the environmental aspects of their religion. In his book bearing the telling title Heidnische Naturreligion (Heathen Religion of Nature), Géza von Neményi, of the ethnicist German Germanische Glaubensgemeinschaft, emphasized the unity of nature, peoples, and spiritual- ity (combined with a New Age doctrine of reincarnation) in a characteristic way, offering Paganism as the solution to the environmental crisis: Each people on this earth had or has its own mythology and variety of nature religion. These have to be revived in order to be able to solve the threatening problems of our age. Because the anti-nature attitude of Christianity has brought us to the brink of self-destruction. The gods work against it: For some time now they primarily have let incarnate indi- viduals who in previous incarnations (previous lives on earth) lived in peoples who were completely in touch with nature. [...] It is the task of these people to rouse mankind to a return to the gods in order to end the destruction of nature.2 2 Géza v. Neményi, Heidnische Naturreligion.

According to one of my interview partners, this is the most important aspect connecting Asatruers to other Icelanders: “They are open to different religious points of view and beliefs. Everybody in Iceland is con- nected to the powers of the earth.”3 A similar conviction is held in Swedish Asatru. Members of the shamanistic network Yggdrasil claimed that it was important to connect to “one’s own soil, own landscape, own climate, light and darkness, the own animal- and plant-life.”4 The idea that it is mainly Christianity’s attitude towards nature that is responsible for the common “ruthlessness against the environment,” was prevalent.5 The Swedish a-racist group Samfundet Forn Sed continues this attitude, and devotes part of its self- description to emphasizing that Norse mythology is based on an ecological bal- ance of which humans are a part. An equally common theme is the claim that culture and myth are formed by climate, landscape, and nature; and that reli- gion, nature, and cultural identity are closely intertwined.6 The American The Troth favors a view of Heathenism in which the gods can be encountered in the forces of nature. Its view of ‘nature religion’ and ’holy earth’ tends to empha- size the importance of seeking the wilderness as a way of connecting with the deities – an attitude which they see in accordance with the practices of the ancient Germanic peoples.7 An interview with a long-term member of Norwegian a-racist Bifrost con- firms that this is still a common theme among Asatruers: Many [Asatruers] have a romantic relationship with nature, like to be in nature, and like natural phenomena. [...] There is something special about this contact with the forces of nature. It is important. To the question if there are connections with the ecology movement, he replies: For some it is surely connected. Because one likes nature, because one likes unspoiled nature, one doesn’t like interference. [...] We don’t live in naturverbunden waren. [...] Aufgabe dieser Menschen ist es, die Menschheit aufzurütteln und zur Rückkehr zu ihren Göttern zu bringen, damit die Naturzerstörung beendet wird.” 3 Interview S. 4 Schnurbein, Religion als Kulturkritik, 200. 5 Ibid., 252. 6 Cf.

[...] And then it maybe becomes important to have ceremonies outdoors, because then we somehow get back a sort of link to nature. [...] There is a romantic idea here, I think – not in a bad way, but in a nice way.8 This quote refers to the fact that such general attitudes about nature are mirrored in the design of Asatru rituals, which not only take place outdoors but also invoke images of rural life, agriculture, nature, fertility, etc. Many of them are organized according to the cycles of the year and life, and invoke the deities almost exclusively in their alleged expressions of forces of nature, growth, fertility and decay, as well as of kin and ancestry. The close proximity posited between exterior and human nature, between an organic culture, landscape, and perception of nature, is reaffirmed in ritual performances, while other aspects of everyday life in modernity take a backseat.9 Few Heathens openly disagree with such common perceptions of Asatru as a religion of nature. Nevertheless, some see it as an anachronism and empha- size the fact that Germanic religion is no longer a religion of nature.10 Others remind their fellow Heathens that all religion is always already cultural, and that the preservation of nature is in fact a modern phenomenon for which ‘the ancestors’ had no concept.11 Still others criticize such general compensa- tory views of nature religion as superficial and call for more concrete action. In an article in the German Eldaring’s journal Herdfeuer, Marcel Behringer confirms the idea that Asatru is a nature religion based on an exchange between humans and environment. From this he derives the moral obligation to develop an ecological conscience. He harshly condemns thoughtless prac- tices in Asatru, which are “limited to weekend walks in the nearby forest. One consumes the poet’s mead in honor of the gods from as big horns as possible, and wallows in impressions of nature which seem to calm our soul.” He 8 Interview O: “[...] mange [...] har et romantisk forhold til natur og liker å være ute i naturen og liker naturfenomener.

One of the first actions of Icelandic Allsherjargodi Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson to come to public attention was to erect a nidstang (nithing pole) against the stationing of atomic weapons on the American airbase in Iceland – an act which contributed to establishing the image of Asatru as an environmental religion as well as a religion of peace and national sovereignty.13 Ivar Hille, the leader of Norwegian Foreningen Forn Sed, emphasizes his for- mer membership in the environmental youth organization Natur og ungdom (Nature and Youth) as well as his membership in the Norwegian Nature Protection Society. He presents environmental activism as an important part of his faith, and espouses a political vision that promotes a return to a society more oriented toward agriculture than industry.14 Henrik Hallgren, chair of the Swedish Samfundet Forn Sed, is one of the most outspoken and differenti- ated defenders of a view of Asatru as an ecological religion and is author of the book The Green Change,15 in which he accounts for his environmental engagement. In some instances, landscape conservation and environmentalism are cen- tral to the self-conception of entire groups. Pagan ideas of a deified, animated nature and landscape, among which ancient heritage sites are counted as well, have motivated activism among English Pagans of all persuasions in recent years. For many of them, the protection of local landscape and remnants of the past has become an important facet of their religion.16 Frequently, this kind of 12 Marcel Behringer, “Naturreligion und ökologisches Bewusstsein,” Herdfeuer.

Michael Strmiska (Santa Barbara, ca: ABC-Clio, 2005). <UN> Asatru 185 nature spirituality finds its expression in practices such as seid or ‘sitting out,’ as they are perceived as ritual activities ensuring a connection to the forces of the earth or nature.17 A number of groups, especially in England and Denmark, have also developed initiatives to buy land – projects in which two motives come together. On the one hand, there is a desire to own and develop a sacred space on which rituals and gatherings can be held without having to make concessions to state authorities or owners. On the other hand, it is seen as a measure to protect natural spaces.18 The quoted statements, as well as the varying group policies, show a strong consensus around ideas of Asatru as a religion of nature. At the same time, this consensus encompasses a wide variety of different concepts of nature and of different ideas about the relationship between humans and the natural envi- ronment. However, it often fails to address their inner contradictions. ‘Nature’ can either mean the present, concrete, immanent world ‘as it is’; or a romanti- cized location of beauty, peace, and authenticity. In some instances, nature religion is a term that serves as a delineation from monotheism. In others, it is connected with a general feeling of being close to nature and seeing humans as part of nature. Pantheist or animist attitudes entail the worship of different beings in the universe or see nature as a bridge to the deities. A closer look at the genealogy of such views and activities in different conservational and envi- ronmental movements of the 19th and 20th century in Germany, England, the usa, and Scandinavia can help us understand the discourses on nature and spirituality in which Asatru is embedded as well as the potential political con- sequences of such attitudes. Environmental Protection, the Heimat-Movement and Völkisch Religion in Germany Germany was certainly not the first country in which nature conservation became a pressing issue in view of the problems posed by a rapid industrializa- 17 See chapter 3. 18 An example for this is the British Ormswald, which was bought and developed by Odinshof as part of a so-called Land Guardians scheme. When the initial land guardians lost their charity status, the Olgar Trust was founded. This trust gained charity status by formulat- ing environmental goals, such as the protection of woodlands.

It was, however, the place where the search for a ‘native’ German religion played a role in the starting phase of the conservation move- ment. The journalist and cultural historian, Wihelm Heinrich Riehl (1823– 1897), was one of the first to develop a systematic critique and vision of the problems caused by untrammeled consumption and the increasing destruc- tion of wild nature. Riehl based his environmental engagement on a Herderian notion of unity between landscape, culture, and nation. The ultra-conservative nationalist was driven by a longing for an idealized pre-modern society19 and promoted an organicistic corporate state based on a traditional rural cul- ture. He saw the materialist, foreign, and un-German Western civilization pro- moted by Jews at the root of the industrialization that destroyed German landscapes.20 This Romantic anti-Semitic conception of Volk and state moti- vated his interest in the mythic and religious basis of German peasantry. A faithful adherent of Jacob Grimm, Riehl thought he had found the essence of German culture in rural customs and practices which, in his eyes, contained remnants of a pre-Christian, primordial German culture. This interest not only made him into an early representative of environmental protection, but also forged his reputation as the founder or forerunner of folklore, cultural history, and sociology.21 19 Frank Uekötter, The Green and the Brown.

(Stuttgart/Augsburg: Cotta, 1851–1869) (Natural History of the German People as the Basis for a German Social Politics). Cf. Olsen, Nature and Nationalism, 64. The nationalist basis for Riehl’s theories about nature become clear in the distinction he made between the “mythic German forest,” which he saw as the essence of the German landscape, and the domesticated park and tilled soil that seemed characteristic for the merely aestheticist and economic quality of French and English landscapes. Cf. Hermann Bausinger, “Zwischen Grün und Braun. Volkstumsideologie und Heimatpflege nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg,” in Religions- und Geistesgeschichte der Weimarer Republik, ed. Hubert Cancik (Düsseldorf: Patmos Verlag, 1982), 216. 21 Methodologically, Riehl proved important for these fields because he pointed to the necessity of studying folk life not through texts, but through immediate observation; an attitude he combined with a rejection of analytical ‘rationalist’ approaches. (Cf. Klaus v. See, Die Ideen von 1789 und die Ideen von 1914.

The political assessment of Riehl differs in these accounts, but all agree on the fundamentally conservative nature of his social politics. Cf.

Zur Geschichte des ökolo- <UN> Asatru 187 The issues of nature protection and the idealization of rural life, as they were first put forward by Riehl, gained momentum in Germany after 1870. This development was fuelled by the change from an agrarian to an industrialized society, which was accompanied by a quick urbanization, a rural exodus, and all the social and economic problems related to such processes. The motives behind this early environmentalism varied considerably, ranging from a Romantic aestheticization of national landscape and the conservative longing for a rootedness in an agrarian society, to economic attempts to ensure autarky.22 This neo-Romantic environmentalist and conservationist constella- tion peaked around 1900, coinciding with the establishment of the völkisch movement and its religious branches. In the spirit of Romantic holistic thought, environmental protection at the time included the protection of the Heimat – the mythical unity of landscape, the past, and rural culture for which ‘homeland’ is an insufficient translation.23 Parts of the urban, bourgeois milieus in which this reaction to industrial mod- ernization originated24 adopted nationalist or völkisch sentiments. However, the movement as a whole became united with the politically diverse life reform and cultural reform associations described in chapter 1, and can be seen as an equivalent to the English Arts and Craft movement.25 The first significant umbrella organization to have combined nature and Heimat protection efforts was the Deutscher Bund Heimatschutz (German Federation for the Protection of the Homeland), founded in 1904 by Ernst Rudorff and Paul Schultze- Naumburg, who became its first president (until 1913).26 The architect, art gischen Bewußtseins (Frankfurt a.M.: Fischer, 1991), 82f; Janet Biehl and Peter Staudenmaier, Ecofascism.

Cf. Hermand, Grüne Utopien in Deutschland, 84. 23 Janet Biehl (Biehl and Staudenmaier, Ecofascism, 35) summarizes succinctly: “The word Heimat connotes as well a turn toward the past, an anti-urban mood, a familiar commu- nity, and proximity to nature.” 24 Bergmann, Agrarromantik und Großstadtfeindschaft, 87. 25 Cf.

Guido von List is a case in point: prior to the development of his spiritual visions, he had been actively engaged in the Austrian Alpine Club and harbored great sympathies for the Heimat movement.27 Parts of the Heimat and nature protection movement, including its found- ing member Wihelm Bölsche and his collaborator Bruno Wille, were influ- enced by Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919), whose theories provided inspiration for modern environmentalism and nature spirituality. The immensely popu- lar German anatomist and zoologist brought Darwin’s evolutionary theory to Germany, and he was responsible for coining the term ‘ecology’ in his 1866 work, “Generelle Morphologie der Organismen” (General Morphology of Organisms).28 Haeckel was heir to an anti-dualistic, pantheistic Romantic sci- entific tradition, which sees natural phenomena as expressions of universal aesthetic and spiritual forces.29 His ideas about the inseparable union between nature and culture led him to apply scientific methods to the study of society as well. According to many critics, this ‘biologizing of ethics’ made him into one of the leading proponents of Social Darwinism. By turning this scientifically based holism into the veritable ‘nature religion’ of what he called ‘monism,’ he gave it a religious foundation.30 Zur politischen Kulturgeschichte Deutschlands 1900–1933, ed. Wolfgang Hardtwig (Munich: R. Oldenbourg Verlag, 2007). 27 Cf. Schnurbein, Religion als Kulturkritik, 240.

The Alps in the ‘Deutscher und Österreichischer Alpenverein’ from the 1860s to 1933,” Austrian Studies 18, no. 1 (2011). 28 For Haeckel, ecology denoted the “economy of nature” or, more aptly, the interactions of all organisms which live together in a place, their adaption to their environment as well as their transformation through their struggle for survival. Cf. Hermand, Grüne Utopien in Deutschland, 71f. 29 Robert J. Richards, The Tragic Sense of Life. Ernst Haeckel and the Struggle over Evolutionary Thought (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008) made the attempt to rehabilitate Haeckel’s legacy with this claim. While he is right in his reading of Haeckel as an heir to a Romantic pantheism, he tends to overlook the ambivalent legacy of Romanticism as such, and uses it to exculpate Haeckel in an apologetic manner. 30 Cf. Hermand, Grüne Utopien in Deutschland, 71f. <UN> Asatru 189 Monism created its organizational base in the Monist League, established in 1906. This “heterogenous alliance”31 shows the ambivalence of Haeckel’s theo- ries, and it mirrors once again the contradictory legacy of Romantic organicis- tic thought. On the one hand, he and the Monist League promoted world peace, anti-militarism, international cooperation, and tolerance for homosexuals,32 as well as a general pan-eroticism which allegedly ruled the collaborative prin- ciple in nature and should serve as a model for a better human society.33 On the other hand, they foregrounded Social Darwinist teachings of natural differ- ences and hierarchies between human races, scientific racism, and eugenics.34 For our context, the promise to mend the split between science and religion is key. Haeckel first promoted this program in his famous 1892 lecture, “Der Monismus als Band zwischen Religion und Wissenschaft” (Monism as the Bond between Religion and Science) and elaborated it in the vastly popular book, “Die Welträthsel” (The Riddle of the Universe, 1899, English translation 1901).35 The book offered an attractive program for the rising immanentist Neopagan religions of his era and proposed a scientific justification for including race hierarchies into these religious currents. Additionally, Haeckel’s thought on evolutionary principles ruling cultural and spiritual matters was consistent 31 Richards, The Tragic Sense of Life, 372. 32 Ibid., 372. 33 Cf. Hermand, Grüne Utopien in Deutschland, 72. 34 Haeckel himself “increasingly pronounced support for aggressive foreign politics and German chauvinism” and strongly endorsed colonial politics (Mario A. Di Gregorio, From Here to Eternity. Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2005), 508f). Daniel Gasman, The Scientific Origins of National Socialism. Social Darwinism in Ernst Haeckel and the German Monist League (New York: Science History Publications, 1971) was the first to forward the claim of a direct continuity between Haeckel’s monism and National Socialist ideology (cf. also Haeckel’s Monism and the Birth of Fascist Ideology (New York: Peter Lang, 1998)). While Richards, The Tragic Sense of Life, (6, 269f, and 448) has shown that it is largely unfounded to make Haeckel responsible for National Socialist racism and anti-Semitism, the totalitarian program of his monism was implicitly anti- liberal because it extended evolutionary principles to matters of the human spirit and culture. Richards (ibid., 269) correctly asserts that Haeckel was no supporter of a racial anti-Semitism, but that his anti-clericalism extended to orthodox Jews, whose assimila- tion Haeckel deemed impossible. However, as I have argued earlier (see chapter 4), such a clear distinction between a racist and a religious motivation of anti-Jewish thought has a tendency to obscure the multiple interactions and the mutual reliance of these argu- mentative patterns.

It laid the foundation for some versions of post-war environmental spirituality that also inherited some of the more problematic aspects of his monism, e.g., its illiberalism, as well as its potential for anti-democratic notions and racial thought.36 Protection and preservation of a rooted, national landscape, nature, and culture, along with the idea of nature as the normative model for human soci- ety, were on the agenda of various reform movements working toward a more natural organic modernity37 – the same movements by which early Germanic Faith was inspired. The German youth movement, with its practical applica- tion of a ‘back to nature’ ethos (i.e., hiking in forests and unspoiled landscapes), promoted a ‘nature spirituality’ set in opposition to the mechanist logic of an alienated modernity.38 Such a “cosmic worldview”39 was celebrated in the essay “Mensch und Erde” (Man and Earth), which Ludwig Klages wrote for the memorable gathering of the youth movement at the Hoher Meissner in 1913.40 Even Klages’ most pronounced critics agree that the life-philosopher offered an astonishing anticipation of just about all of the themes of the contemporary ecology movement: It decried the extinction of species, disturbance of global ecosystemic balance, deforestation, destruction of aboriginal peoples and of wild habitats, urban sprawl, and the increasing alienation of people from nature. In emphatic terms, it disparaged Christianity, capitalism, eco- nomic utilitarianism, hyperconsumption, and the ideology of ‘progress.’ It even condemned the environmental destructiveness of rampant tour- ism and the slaughter of whales, and displayed a clear recognition of the planet as an ecological totality.41 As we have seen in chapter 5, Klages, as well as his followers then and today, did not limit themselves to a critique of instrumental reason. Rather, they com- pletely rejected a logocentrism (the “Geist,” as Klages puts it) whose origin 36 Di Gregorio, From Here to Eternity, 490. 37 Rohkrämer, Eine andere Moderne?, 124. 38 Cf. ibid., 141–156. 39 Winfried Mogge, “Religiöse Vorstellungen der deutschen Jugendbewegung,” in Religions- und Geistesgeschichte der Weimarer Republik, ed.

Klages wanted to replace it with ‘bio-centrism,’ a philosophy based on experience instead of sci- entific intersubjectivity.42 Thus, the Kosmiker’s Greek, Roman, and Germanic- based Neopagan worldview took on notions of a chthonic earth-and-blood-based spirituality. Also, in the cases of Klages, the Kosmische Runde, and the youth movement a deep ambiguity is at work between a profound insight into the consequences of a mechanistic modernity and instrumental reason, and a propagation of potentially totalitarian and not only anti-clerical, but also anti- Jewish, thought.43 The early German Faith Movement was clearly influenced by Romantic con- cepts of Pagan nature, earth, and fertility rites. In their cultic dramas, both Ludwig Fahrenkrog and Ernst Wachler depicted Norse gods, such as Baldur, as protagonists of seasonal myths.44 The iconography of the German Faith Movement points in a similar direction. Ludwig Fahrenkrog painted the god Baldur blessing the fields in various versions. Hugo Höppener (alias Fidus), the star-artist of the life reform and youth movements, became famous with his paintings and drawings of naked, healthy, young, blond-haired and blue-eyed, muscular bodies celebrating a cult of light and air in open fields and mountain landscapes – the most famous and frequently reproduced being the “Lichtgebet” (Light Prayer).45 Early promoters of a Germanic Faith also combined racist and eugenic ideals with the ‘back to nature’ ideology of alternative rural communi- ties promoted by the settlement movement. The biologist and radical völkisch protagonist, Willibald Hentschel, developed the idea of a ‘Mittgart’ colony for racial breeding.46 To him and his followers, urbanization, industrialization, money, economy, and luxury appeared as signs of the Aryan race’s degenera- tion, which had to be combated by a healthier and more natural life in rural colonies.

Beck, 2011), 60– 74, emphasizes the strong pacifist, non-aggressive, non-chauvinist tendencies in the life reform movement, and the anti-centralist, international strands within the Heimat protection movement. However, he fails to mention the simultaneously existing ideas of racial hierarchy and eugenicism, as well as the anti-Semitism characteristic of the Neopagan and neo-Germanic strands within these movements. 44 See for example Wachler, Mittsommer. Trauerspiel mit Chören für die Bühne unter freiem Himmel, Fahrenkrog, Baldur. 45 For an in-depth discussion of these aesthetic aspects of the German Faith Movement and Asatru see chapter 9. 46 Willibald Hentschel, Varuna. Das Gesetz des aufsteigenden und sinkenden Lebens in der Geschichte (Leipzig: Matthes, 1902). <UN> 192 chapter 6 so-called ‘Mittgart-polygamy’: a ratio of one male settler to ten women would ensure the quick and effective breeding of racially pure children.47 Hentschel never put his ideas into practice, but they inspired the Donnershag settlement, which Ernst Hunkel, of the Deutschgläubige Gemeinschaft, founded in 1919 in Sontra. It combined such racial breeding ideas with the goal of economic autarky through agriculture and crafts, as well as cooperative land use.48 Spiritualized holistic ecology-cum-racial breeding and eugenics made an impression on the margins of National Socialism and policies as well, espe- cially through the Artamanen movement. Inspired by Hentschel, as well as völkisch and Heimatschutz ideals, the Artamanen formed in the early 1920s, with the goal of colonizing Eastern Europe through agricultural settlements. By 1927, they had practically become a section of the National Socialist party, counting a number of future leaders of the National Socialist state among their members: the later head of the ss, Heinrich Himmler; Rudolf Höß, who was to become the commander of Auschwitz; the racial ideologue, Hans F.K. Günther; and future Reichsbauernführer (Reich Peasant Leader) Walter Darré, the infa- mous propagator of the catch-phrase “blood and soil.”49 Heimatschutz ideas of a völkisch conservationism thus exerted a certain influence on National Socialist politics and found their expression in laws on animal protection, small scale and organic farming, hunting, and landscape architecture.50 47 Cf. Dieter Löwenberg, “Willibald Hentschel (1858–1947), seine Pläne zur Menschen- züchtung, sein Biologismus und Antisemitismus” (Dissertation, Universität Mainz, 1978), 9–29; Ulrich Linse, Zurück, o Mensch, zur Mutter Erde. Landkommunen in Deutschland 1890–1933 (Munich: dtv, 1983), 188f. 48 Zurück, o Mensch, zur Mutter Erde, 188–197. 49 Based on scant evidence from Darré’s defence at the Nuremburg trials, Anna Bramwell has made out Walter Darré as a naïve and harmless early promoter of small scale farming and green thought (cf. Anna Bramwell, Blood and Soil. Walther Darré and Hitler’s Green Party (Abbotsbrook: Kensal Press, 1985), Ecology in the 20th Century. A History (New Haven/London: Yale University Press, 1989)). Such claims have been thoroughly rebuked in later scholarship, which clarified that Darré was heavily involved in the ns policy of agrarian expansionism, cf. Gesine Gerhard, “Breeding Pigs and People for the Third Reich. Richard Walther Darré’s Agrarian Ideology,” in How Green Were the Nazis? Nature, Environment and Nation in the Third Reich, ed.

Olsen, Nature and Nationalism, 73–80, see also Luc Ferry, The New Ecological Order, trans. Carol Volk (Chicago/London: University of Chicago Press, 1995), 104–107. In focus- ing mostly on biologist Walther Schoenichen’s laws for animal protection, Ferry over- states his point of direct continuities between National Socialist views of environmentalism and contemporary deep ecology. But he is able to show the existence of an ethno-pluralist <UN> Asatru 193 Völkisch and National Socialist concepts of nature, conservationism and environmentalism were driven by two different, but intersecting, concepts of how to account for the ‘nature’ of the Volk, and consequently two different concepts of nature religion. One is the ‘soil’ idea of an outer nature: consisting of landscape, climate, vegetation, and fauna, which forms peoples and cul- tures, and which therefore must be preserved. This strand emphasizes the col- laborative principle in ecosystems. It is conservative and anti-liberal in its political outlook, tending toward cultural anti-capitalist, xenophobic, and anti-Jewish attitudes, although usually lacking in outward aggression. The other strand emphasizes the ‘blood’ component. It posits an inner human nature, which is characterized by racial features that are formed by their habi- tats, resulting in certain races becoming expansionist ‘by nature.’ Such con- cepts of an inner nature tend toward a Social Darwinist ideology of a struggle for survival, in which the strongest and most enterprising races and peoples, which originate in the harsh Northern climates, ‘naturally’ subjugate the weaker peoples of the South and East.51 Nevertheless, already the agrarian Romanticism of the late 19th century combined elements of both concepts, for example by pointing out the signifi- cance of rural areas in preserving the resilience and military strength of a people. The diverging ideologies also share anti-Jewish sentiments, since they perceive the ‘rootless’ and ‘landless’ south-eastern Judaism as hostile to either version of ‘nature.’52 Furthermore, both promoted an anti-Christian Pagan paradigm in National Socialist policies, which emphasized that peoples and races were just as worthy of preservation and in need of being kept pure and tied to their nature as animal and plant species. For a balanced assessment of the inconsistencies within National Socialist conservationism as the result of the ns state’s “institutional anarchy,” see Uekötter, The Green and the Brown, 9. The unresolved tension between a “blood and soil” ideology and the militarist-technological “reactionary modernism” (Jeffrey Herf, Reactionary Modernism. Technology, Culture and Politics in Weimar and the Third Reich (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984)), which also propelled National Socialist policies, was also never resolved and is another example of the multifaceted conglomer- ate of ideologies of which National Socialism was comprised. 51 Cf. Mark Bassin, “Blood or Soil? The Völkisch Movement, the Nazis, and the Legacy of Geopolitik,” in How Green Were the Nazis? Nature, Environment and Nation in the Third Reich, ed.

Alfred Rosenberg’s “Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts” (The Myth of the 20th Century)53 exemplifies the mythic foundation of nature spirituali- ty’s ‘blood’ strand. The Nazis’ chief ideologist took up and expounded upon all the anti-clerical, anti-Semitic and anti-Christian ideas of völkisch religion. He promoted a ‘Nordic’ religion that allegedly affirmed life and immediate experi- ence, overthrew dualisms, and upheld the belief in the creation of a ‘New Man’ through natural struggle.54 Both concepts also spurred research in the human- ities during the ‘Third Reich.’ A case in point is an encompassing research pro- ject initiated by the ss Ahnenerbe based on the idea of the forest as the embodiment of the Indo-European or Germanic religious essence.55 We can conclude that the idea of nature spirituality as an alternative to an allegedly anti-natural Judeo-Christianity becomes popularized in the politi- cally ambiguous reform movements of the early 20th century. Through their proximity to the völkisch movement, and through shared ideas about a union between nature and a nation or Volk, such concepts formed more general ideas about the essence of Germanic spirituality. At the same time, Germanic reli- gious ideas entered into general discourses on nature and spirituality. Thus, while we cannot say that all ‘green’ ideas and ecological politics originate in Campus, 2003), 174–180, shows how the anti-Jewish tendency within the conservationist movement in Germany increased, especially after 1918. 53 Alfred Rosenberg, Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts (Munich: Hoheneichen, 1930). English translation: The Myth of the Twentieth Century. An Evaluation of the Spiritual-Intellectual Confrontations of our Age (Torrance, ca: Noontide Press, 1982). 54 Robert A. Pois, National Socialism and the Religion of Nature (London/Sidney: Croom Helm, 1986) uses Rosenberg’s religious ideas as central evidence for the Nazi “religion of nature” not recognizing the diverging concepts of nature either. 55 Cf.

Perspektiven eines Kulturthemas, ed. Albrecht Lehmann and Klaus Schriewer (Hamburg: Reimer, 2000). This project not only contributed to anchoring the general idea of the sacrality of the German forest even further in the popular imagina- tion, but also firmly established the idea of the Christmas tree as an ancient Germanic practice. Cf. Hermann Bausinger, “Das Weihnachtsfest der Volkskunde. Zwischen Mythos und Alltag,” in Politische Weihnacht in Antike und Moderne. Zur ideologischen Durch- dringung des Fests der Feste, ed.

Richard Faber and Esther Gajek (Würzburg: Königshausen & Neumann, 1997). <UN> Asatru 195 this constellation, it is safe to claim that the idea of Germanic religion being an ecological religion has some of its roots here.56 The ‘soil’ and ‘blood’ elements of nature religion were carried over into early post-war green movements in Germany, where concepts of an indige- nous Germanic or Nordic nature spirituality also played a role. In the 1980s, the emerging German Green Party had to battle right-wing extremist cur- rents within their ranks. This was a result of the fact that the ideological heri- tage of Heimatschutz and völkisch conservationism was foundational to the network of cultural and religious associations in which former National Socialists and völkisch protagonists, under the guise of ‘spirituality’ and ‘ culture-work,’ gathered in post-war Germany: the Weltbund zum Schutz des Lebens, the associated Collegium Humanum, and the German Unitarians.57 Their environmental ideology included a strong stance against abortion, as well as nuclear power and weaponry. The anti-Christian and (Germanic) Neopagan tendency of this post-war right-wing ecological movement in Germany found its expression in a rejection of the “anti-natural” “Levantine moral codex” that had been “forced upon” the Europeans,58 as well as in the promotion of a return to “European nature spirituality” or an “Occidental 56 Few authors who have investigated the roots of the German green movement in the Heimat and nature protection movements, the life reform movement, and early National Socialist environmental engagement have truly come to terms with the fundamental ambiguity of these intellectual and activist currents. The most differentiated discussions can be found in the seminal works of Ulrich Linse, Zurück, o Mensch, zur Mutter Erde; Ökopax und Anarchie. In English, Jonathan Olsen’s investigations into “right-wing ecol- ogy” give the most balanced account. Biehl and Staudenmaier, Ecofascism, at times fall prey to an oversimplified theory of direct continuities of an all-encompassing “eco- fascism,” a stance which they justify and correct in the foreword to the book’s new edition (cf. Ecofascism Revisited. Lessons from the German Experience (Porsgrunn: New Compass Press, 2011)). Anna Bramwell, Ecology in the 20th Century and Raymond Dominick, The Environmental Movement in Germany, on the other hand minimize the ideologically prob- lematic aspects of the theories and activities of protagonists such as Haeckel, Darré, Klages etc. 57 See chapter 1.

Together with his wife, he gathered a net- work of right-wing environmentalists which connected youth organizations such as the Bund Heimattreuer Jugend and the Wiking Jugend (which, as shown in chapter 2, were breeding grounds for future founders and members of the Armanen Orden). A connection to the Artgemeinschaft was facilitated through the intertwining of the wsl with the Gesellschaft für biologische Anthropologie, Eugenik und Verhaltensforschung (Society for Biological Anthropology, Eugenics and Etology), both of which were headed by the lawyer Jürgen Rieger. The Society promotes a scientific racism in the tradition of H.F.K. Günther, cf. Wölk, Natur und Mythos.

Aside from Haverbeck himself, the main proponents of such a pantheistic return to European nature- spirituality were the former Catholic theologian and well-known church critic, Hubertus Mynarek, who in the 1980s had close contact to the dur, (Hubertus Mynarek, Ökologische Religion. Ein neues Verständnis der Natur (Munich: Goldmann, 1986)) as well as the German Unitarian, Peter Bahn, and the co-founder of the Green party, the organic farmer Baldur Springmann, also German Unitarian, who also held contacts with the Deuts ch- gläubige Gemeinschaft.

Colin Riordan (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1997). <UN> Asatru 197 Xenophobic right-wing ecologism had a certain influence on the early Green Party in the 1980s as well.63 This was facilitated by a number of shared ideological convictions, such as the critique of mindless consumerism, moral pessimism, the rejection of Enlightenment (not only its progressive and techno logical bias, but its humanism and universalism as well), and sometimes even the call for authoritarian measures or dictatorial systems.64 Most impor- tantly though, both eco-left and eco-right harbor(ed) a tendency to consider nature also as a model for the social world, leading them to promote a variety of political systems ranging anywhere between democratic and authoritarian. They couched their ideas in a spiritual rhetoric of Heimat, belonging, and the ‘protection of life’ – a tendency that motivated them to embrace Ernst Haeckel and Ludwig Klages as early Greens.65 Asatruers Géza von Neményi and Michael Pflanz, both founding members of the Heidnische Gemeinschaft, were actively 63 The conviction that Judeo-Christian monotheism and its dualism, which separated humans from nature, was the main culprit for the exploitation of the earth and the immi- nent ecological catastrophe, was a driving force behind the early green movement in Germany as well. Jost Hermand has analyzed such a reactivation of an older critique of religion in the name of the environment as a scapegoating of an “other” motivated by the inability to see oneself as profiting from this exploitation. This reactivation could occa- sionally be found on the left of the political spectrum. Examples include Carl Améry’s passionate attack on the “merciless consequences of Christianity” (this is the subtitle of Carl Améry, Das Ende der Vorsehung. Die gnadenlosen Folgen des Christentums (Reinbek b. Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1972)) and Otto Ullrich’s charges against the “Judeo-Christian reli- gion” and its “disdain for the organic world” (Otto Ullrich, Weltniveau. In der Sackgasse des Industriesystems (Berlin: Rotbuch, 1979), 43). Améry later invoked “the old faith,” which he thought had survived as a substratum in Bavarian Catholicism, as an effective immuniza- tion against the “pagan Conservatism” of Conservative Revolutionaries and racial theo- rists, such as Arthur Möller van den Bruck and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, cf. Carl Améry, “Deutscher Konservatismus und der faschistische Graben. Versuch einer zeitge- schichtlichen Bilanz,” in Neue soziale Bewegungen: Konservativer Aufbruch im bunten Gewand? Arbeitspapiere einer Diskussionsrunde, ed. Wolf Schäfer (Frankfurt a.M.: Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, 1983), 14. 64 The former gdr dissident and early member of the Green party, Rudolf Bahro, reasoned that an eco-dictatorship on spiritual (not Neopagan) grounds was the only means of avoiding the environmental catastrophe, cf. Peter Thompson, “New Age Mysticism, Postmodernism and Human Liberation,” in Green Thought in German Culture. Historical and Contemporary Perspectives, ed. Colin Riordan (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1997), 109; Olsen, Nature and Nationalism, 101. 65 For a balanced and informed discussion of these commonalities between left and right- wing ecology in Germany see Nature and Nationalism, 100–108. <UN> 198 chapter 6 involved in the Berlin branch of the Green Party in the 1980s, a fact which caused a fierce public debate about right-wing infiltration of the party.66 We can conclude that there are clear continuities from völkisch and Hei- matschutz ideas to post-war right-wing ecologism. Nevertheless, the fairly widespread idea in contemporary Asatru that Christianity or monothe- ism in general is detrimental to the natural environment, and that Paganism provides an ecologically sustainable spirituality, cannot be explained by an ideological-historical investigation into such German back- grounds alone. Nature Religion in England and the United States Modern nature spirituality also builds on English, and especially American, models that combined visions of a non-exploitative unity between humans and nature with political ideals ranging from democratic or socialist to conser- vative and nationalist. Some of their roots lie in the English garden city, the 19th century idealization of rural England,67 or the Romantic socialism of William Morris, who imagined a classless society without private property based on agriculture and crafts. D.H. Lawrence’s ideas regarding a worship of nature, which were inspired by Ernst Haeckel and the counter-cultural envi- ronment of Ascona, provided further stimulation.68 Parts of the early 20th century back-to-nature movement in England combined their engagement for the environment and land reform with Anglo-Saxon or Teutonic spirituality. The Kindred of the Kibbo Kifts, a breakaway scout group that was in contact with factions of the German youth movement, combined pantheism and an interest in Eastern religions and Native American spirituality with Anglo- Saxon nationalism; socialist, pacifist, eugenic ideas; and an elitist government ideal.69 Rolf Gardiner, a promoter of folk dance and dance reform with links to the German life reform movement, harbored dreams of a united Pagan England and Germany in the hope of their collective spiritual rebirth. Gardiner was actively involved with the international far right between the wars. His ideas on nature and spirituality led to his promotion of both organic farming 66 Cf. “Mythos der Edda,” Der Spiegel, January 07, 1985. 67 Cf.

The reflections he had during a two- year period spent in a small cabin in the woodlands, which he documented in his book Walden (1854) became a key text for the hippie, New Age, and envi- ronmental movements of the latter part of the 20th century. As Catherine L. Albanese has shown in her seminal work, Nature Religion in America, the tran- scendentalists’ ‘biocentric’ Romanticism was characterized by a mostly unac- knowledged confusion between two views of matter and nature: an idealistic one, which perceived matter as “illusion and unreality, ultimately a trap from which one needed to escape,” and a pantheistic-vitalistic one, which saw mat- ter and nature as the ultimate reality and thus the source of authentic spiritu- ality.72 It is a similar contradiction to that of the ‘outer’ and ‘inner’ nature previously seen in the German tradition, which also spurred nature protection as well as life reform movements. This contradiction proved to be fairly pro- ductive, leading to the emergence of two seminal movements that remained entwined, and also contributed to different varieties of modern New Age and Neopagan nature spirituality: the preservationist movement; and the mind- cure movement, with its Romantic ideas about using the natural magnetic forces governing organisms for the healing of both body and soul.73 Although the American preservationist movement, and especially its cen- tral protagonist John Muir (1838–1914), shared basic assumptions about the significance of nature with both German 19th century naturalists and English conservationists, their course of action differed due to different social and political conditions. The German Heimat and environmental protection move- ments focused on the necessity of anchoring humans in the landscape in which they reside, thus promoting a conservative, exclusionary, and xenopho- bic ideal of small-scale farming communities as well as anti-Enlightenment, 70 Bramwell, Ecology in the 20th Century, 113–116. 71 Cf. Gregorius, Modern Asatro, 181f. 72 Catherine L. Albanese, Nature Religion in America. From the Algonkian Indians to the New Age, ed. Martin E. Marty, Chicago History of American Religion (Chicago/London: University of Chicago Press, 1990), 82. It should be added that the same implicit contra- diction was characteristic of German and English Romantic perceptions of nature. It is likely that some of the German idealist concepts of the sublime were transferred to the American transcendentalists via the mediation of English Romanticism. 73 Ibid., 108. <UN> 200 chapter 6 anti-French revolution, and anti-emancipatory ideas.74 The English conserva- tionists were motivated by an idealization of rural England. The American preservationists, however, were occupied with safeguarding the possibility of experiencing the sublime in nature, and thus were committed to the preserva- tion of purportedly unspoiled wilderness areas75 – ideals which led to the foundation of national parks as well as the wilderness association Sierra Club. In all three countries, increasing urbanization resulted in the desire to ‘return to nature,’ and in the inception of various youth movements and organiza- tions. It seems significant that scouting organizations in both Great Britain and America promoted individualism and expansionism with military and imperi- alist overtones, relying strongly on a Christian basis. These political and social ideals stand in contrast to the far less centrally organized sections of the German youth movement and their pantheistic Neopaganism.76 Thoreau combined the preservationist and mind-cure rhetoric with his own version of an eclectic Hinduism, which led him to “confessions of paganism,” while Muir started replacing “God” with “nature” and “beauty” in his writing. These anti-Christian notions notwithstanding, both preservationism and ‘mind-cure,’ which later influenced Neopaganism, relied mainly on a Calvinist and evangelical tradition (a relation similar to German Romanticism’s debt to Pietist religiosity).77 A more outspokenly anti-Christian impulse entered the 74 Linse, “‘Fundamentalistischer’ Heimatschutz. Die ‘Naturphilosophie’ Reinhard Falters,” 158. 75 For a recent in depth discussion of the transcendentalists’ influence on modern nature spirituality see Bron Taylor, Dark Green Religion. Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2010), 42–70. 76 Nevertheless, also in the United States xenophobic and anti-immigrant arguments gained traction within ecological and nature preservation rhetoric. In 1996, the Sierra Club dis- cussed a “motion stating that environmental concerns called for restricted immigration” (Gardell, Gods of the Blood, 313). It was turned down by a small margin, cf. Olsen, Nature and Nationalism, 139f. 77 Albanese, Nature Religion in America, 89, 95, 99. This Christian tradition of nature religion goes back to early 19th century North America, where it was associated with the biblical paradigm of Eden, the original garden. Drawing on the aesthetic notion of the sublime, the transcendentalists in particular transformed this aesthetic category into a “Chris- tianized mark of the Deity resident in nature,” a fusion of the aesthetic and the religious which led to the “appropriation of the landscape for religious and ultimately [...] nation- alist purposes,” (Barbara Novak, Nature and Culture. American Landscape and Painting 1825–1875, 3. ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), 7). Accordingly, Thoreau as well as Muir have been criticized for anti-democratic attitudes, and Muir’s misanthropic state- ments, often directed against the urban poor, Native Americans, and African slaves, have warranted skepticism, (Cf. Taylor, Dark Green Religion, 70). Considering the practice of <UN> Asatru 201 American environmental movement in the 1960s in the form of a seminal essay by Lynn White Jr. The ucla professor of medieval history located “The Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis” in the “activist” and pro-techonological mentality of medieval Christianity.78 The argument was eagerly taken up by parts of the environmental movement both in America as well as Europe, which cited spiritual reasons for the current ecological crisis. The anti-clerical and anti-monotheist call for a “new story, a new myth, and a new religion” that “replace[s] anthropocentrism with biocentrism” and a holistic view which sees “the Earth, her ecosystems, and species as sacred”79 became more prominent in parts of the green movement, in particular in deep ecology. The foundation for an ecological spirituality was sought in sources imagined to have originated outside the traditions of “Judeo-Christianity,” Platonic dualism, and “Western civilization,” i.e., in Western appropriations of Taoism, Zen Buddhisim, mysti- cism, as well as in the pantheist, polytheist, animist,80 and allegedly “ecocen- tric religions and ways of life of primal peoples”81 thought to be connected to the “roots of a regenerative spirituality grounded in the natural world.”82 In this constellation, the ‘nature religions’ of Native Americans,83 as well as neo-shamanism, gained significance and were promoted within New Age displacing indigenous peoples from their land in order to create national parks, it does not seem far-fetched to claim that American nature Romanticism also followed a colonial logic (Cf. Joachim Radkau, Natur und Macht. Eine Weltgeschichte der Umwelt (Munich: C.H. Beck, 2000), 215; Nature and Power. A Global History of the Environment (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), 234). 78 Cf. Ralph Metzner, “The Emerging Ecological Worldview,” in Worldviews and Ecology, ed.

For a systematic discussion of reli- gious forms of environmentalism see Taylor, Dark Green Religion. In a chapter on the “Ecology of Religion,” Joachim Radkau, Nature and Power (77–85), rejects the idea of a development of religions from immanence to transcendence, tracing it back to 19th cen- tury evolutionism. According to him, most religions contain elements of both, as well as of anthropocentrism. He also warns against confusing the history of religious ideas with the real history of the environment, pointing out that tree cults may well be prominent in societies which further deforestation and that mother cults co-exist with or even promote the exploitation of women.

Neopagans, such as the prominent feminist witch Starhawk, gave their religious movements an activist direction by choosing environmentalism as their political forum.84 This, along with growing concerns about neo- colonialist exploitation of native spirituality and culture, led to a search for ecological perspectives in ‘indigenous Paganism.’ Graham Harvey’s dictum about an “elective affinity between paganism and ecology”85 is thus quite pre- cise, although he does not address the question of which conceptions of nature underlie this “affinity.” The British Pagan and lecturer for religious studies instead perpetuates the argument that Neopaganism is a religion of pure imma- nence, invoking the idea that it is “nature itself” and an “intimacy with the land” that forms the basis of Paganism, and that the “chief sources of authority are in Nature,” leading to a worldview of cyclical time and rooted spatiality.86 Critics of an anti-humanist eco-spirituality have pointed out the political implications of a deep ecological spirituality of immanence that turns the bio- sphere into a quasi-divine entity combining Spinozean or Goethean pantheism with Nietzschean vitalism. They point out the parallels between völkisch and National Socialist biocentrism, and “the new ecological order which can lead to either an exclusionist, xenophobic policy or the call for an eco-dictatorship and even the elimination of humans.”87 As has been demonstrated, constructing Sociological and Philosophical Perspectives, ed.

Harvey’s interest for eco-Paganism has brought him to embrace what he calls ‘bioregional animism,’ a worldview in which the Cartesian gap between human and nature is supposedly overcome by seeing “the world or cosmos” as a “diverse community of living persons (only some of whom are human).” Cf. http://www.animism.org.uk/, last accessed January 14, 2013, as well as Animism.

Zimmermann, “Possible Poli- tical Problems of Earth-Based Religiosity,” in Beneath the Surface. Critical Essays in the Philosophy of Deep Ecology, ed. Eric Katz, Andrew Light, and David Rothenberg (Cam bridge, MA/London: The mit Press, 2000). Michael Zimmermann had initially developed a deep ecological philosophy on the basis of Martin Heidegger’s thought, which he revoked in an article from 2002, having realized the implications of Heidegger’s anti-humanist philosophy. For a balanced discussion of Heidegger’s views of the rela- tions between community and nature, as well as his critique of modernity, see Thomas Rohkrämer, “German Cultural Criticism. The Desire for a Sense of Place and Community,” <UN> Asatru 203 direct lines between National Socialist ideas on nature and contemporary ecol- ogy is an over-simplification.88 Nevertheless, it is no coincidence that a German intellectual tradition is invoked here, betraying the affinity between these ver- sions of eco-spirituality, Romantic organicism, and völkisch thought, pointing to a fundamental philosophical problem in biocentric ideologies. The lack of a theory of the subject (and subjectivity) in deep ecology leads to the widespread conviction within environmentalism that s cientific ecology not only offers a model to describe the world, but can and should also serve as a “prescriptive model of how we as humans ought to fit in.”89 Deep ecology does not search for new ways to conceptualize subjectivity and sociality in the wake of the Cartesian subject’s demise. Instead, it creates a meta-narrative in which an original state of harmony between human and nature is followed by a ‘fall’ into disenchantment, which consequently has to be counteracted by ‘re-enchanting’ the world and reestablishing the previous natural order. Such calls for a ‘spiri- tual’ solution oriented toward a deep past, in which the separation of human and nature can be dissolved and immediacy regained, does indeed bear simi- larities to German Romantic as well as völkisch thought.90 It implies a natural- ization of social life and neglects the fact that the laws of nature, to which everything is to be subjected, are themselves necessarily the result of cognition, and thus of the separation of human thought from what this thought con- structs as ‘nature.’ What is conceptualized as ‘nature’ and becomes normative in this kind of nature philosophy cannot be anything but a projection of human values. The consequence is a naturalization of such values, an operation serv- ing to immunize them from political critique, presenting them as irreducible and resistant to analysis. Consequently, the proposed political solutions are often undemocratic, sometimes leading to the call for an eco-dictatorship in the service of the higher goal of saving the earth.91 in Making a New World.

In his analysis of Lion King, he points to the message of the interconnected- ness of all beings that the film espouses. We might raise the counterargument that the ideal here is one of a Social Darwinist kingdom in which a natural hierarchy is defended, according to which every creature has a pre-ordained place that it has to find and fulfill. (Taylor, Dark Green Religion). <UN> 204 chapter 6 Nature and National Identity in Scandinavia So far, we can discern three major influences on Asatru conceptions of nature religion, all of which originate in Romantic conceptions of nature: (1) German discourse on Heimat and nature protection, which fused with a soil-and-forest- based natural and national spirituality and influenced the German(ic) Faith Movement; (2) American transcendentalist nature religion, which had a major impact on New Age and Neopagan spirituality in general; and (3) the English pastoral and rural tradition, which gave rise to the fertility cult of Wicca. In order to understand the specific views of nature in contemporary Heathenism, we also have to consider the Scandinavian countries and the way in which images of Northern nature merged with the reception of Nordic myth in the creation of European perceptions of the North, along with Scandinavian national self-perceptions. The Nordic countries are traditionally seen as places with an abundance of unspoiled nature, with populations that build their mentality and culture on a special proximity to nature. Although images of landscape and nature have been formative for Norwegian and Swedish constructions of national identity,92 such perceptions have not been systematically investigated. For our purposes, we can at least discern a few external and internal factors that have contributed to such images. Adding to pre-existing ideas on climate theory ideas that lent the North, its myths, and its culture a particular tinge of the melancholic, the heroic, and the sublime, 19th century German, Norwegian, and Swedish landscape painting cemented the idea of the North as the site of the sublime and the authentic in the imaginations of educated Europeans and Scandinavians alike.93 Scandinavian artists trained in the 92 Cf.

The most popular paintings of the era became national icons in their respective coun- tries, e. g. the Norwegian painters’ Adolph Tidemand and Hans Fredrik Gude’s Bridal <UN> Asatru 205 German painting academies of Dresden and Düsseldorf brought German Romantic conceptions of landscape and nature with them as they returned to their respective countries. Around 1900, interchanges between internal and external perceptions of a ‘Nordic’ relation to nature were intensified by the increase in tourism from England and Germany to Sweden and Norway.94 The reshaping of nature in industrialized countries led to an interest in landscapes that were seen as unspoiled, and to the desire to experience the sublime and primordial in such landscapes. The subsequent development of tourism in the Alps95 and parts of the Nordic countries is a result of such desires.96 In the views of German tourists in particular, both the Alpine and the Scandinavian sublime and authentic land- scape appeared as specifically Germanic and Nordic,97 and a discourse on Nordic nature was easily folded into the discourse on Nordic mythic heroism. Around the same time, modern Scandinavian art and literature were received enthusiastically in German intellectual circles, a reception which fur- ther solidified conceptualizations of the North as a source of authenticity, youth, and modernity. The painter Carl Larsson’s idyllic interiors were pub- lished by Eugen Diederichs, who emphasized the unity between a healthy fam- ily life (represented by vigorous, blond-haired and blue-eyed children) and a modern rural interior architecture.98 Larsson himself not only praised the Procession in Hardanger (1848) depicting rowboats with peasants in national costumes on their way to a wedding in the spectacular fjord and mountain landscape of Hardanger. Reproductions adorn many Norwegian homes up until today. By placing scenes of Christian ritual, such as weddings and funerals, as well as national costumes, in fjord and mountain landscapes, they were both nationalized and sacralized. 94 In his history of environmentalism in Norway, Bredo Berntsen, Grønne linjer. Natur- og miljøvernets historie i Norge (Oslo: Grøndahl og Dreyer, 1994), 23, illustrates the fundamen- tal significance of English nature tourism (especially for hunting and fishing) since the 1820s and the foundation of the Norwegian Tourist Association in 1868 for the emergence of this particular view of nature. 95 Cf. Peniston-Bird, Rohkrämer, and Schulz, “Glorified, Contested and Mobilized.” 96 In the case of Norway, the fact that Emperor William ii spent summers on his yacht in Norwegian fjords contributed greatly to popularizing the Norwegian coastal landscape as a touristic destination, at the same time emphasizing the perception of this landscape as Germanic.

In a style that is reminiscent of Fidus’ temple drafts, he interpreted the sacrifice of a mythic Swedish king as the expression of a cult of sacred kingship, fertility, and nature, explaining the first sketch for this painting with the following words in 1911: Here, a king is sacrificed for his people’s welfare (to enable a good annual harvest).

Han dränkes i den heliga källan <UN> Asatru 207 Images of rootedness and naturalness also formed the perception of Scandi- navian early modernist literature in Germany. At the time, works by Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg were not understood as inspired by French naturalism. Rather, their naturalist aspects were interpreted as an expression of a particular Nordic (human) nature.101 Thus, while the German life reform move ment in general might not have been driven by a particular enthusiasm for Northern nature,102 artists and writers who were inspired by life reform ensured vivid exchanges of what we might call ‘Nordic nature spirituality.’ Such attitudes also fueled the reception of Knut Hamsun’s (1859–1952) literary works. The Norwegian author and Nobel Prize winner’s novel Pan (1894), about a former lieutenant who tries to find balance and spiritual regeneration in the forests of northern Norway, has been enthusiastically received as a manifesto of nature worship by both German contemporaries and, later on, deep ecolo- gists.103 Furthermore, his 1917 novel Growth of the Soil has been used as an example of the natural and simple yet fulfilled life of a peasant connected to his land. What is lacking from this picture of deep nature worship is Hamsun’s contempt for modernity, his authoritarian political inclinations, his dreams of a great Germanic empire, and his active support for Hitler and the German occupation regime of the 1940s – a revealing omission which points at the very least to blind spots in the views of deep ecologists.104 vid trädets fot (framför templet stod enligt Adam von Bremen ett träd, som grönskade hela året).” The painting was highly controversial for its lack of historical accuracy and overly emphatic and operatic style and eventually rejected by the Swedish National Museum in Stockholm for which it was intended.

Wisdom in the Open Air (Minneapolis/London: University of Minnesota Press, 1993), 11. 104 A different reading of Hamsun’s texts as deconstructions of such modern nature worship and its violent and inhuman consequences is possible and does more justice to his com- plex literary texts (cf. Stefanie v. Schnurbein, “Failed Seductions: Crises of Masculinity in Knut Hamsun’s Pan and Knut Faldbakken’s Glahn,” Scandinavian Studies 73, no. 2 (2001); “Und ewig singen die Wälder.

Bernd Henningsen (Berlin: Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag, 2005); “Knut Hamsun’s Narrative <UN> 208 chapter 6 We can summarize that the image of the nature-oriented Nordic mentality and culture emerged via a complex interplay between stereotypes formed by insiders and outsiders. It was constructed and exchanged in the arts and media, as well as in the emerging tourism industry and alternative life reform move- ments. The image became entrenched after World War ii, through a similar interaction of an expanding mass tourism with the German film industry of the 1950s and 60s, which revived the image of Heimat as a site of a nostalgic and wholesome rural, natural world.105 Eventually, the Scandinavian countries would employ such images of wholesomeness and unspoiled nature in the ser- vice of modern nation branding. Right-Wing Ecologism and Asatru As we have seen, the images of a spiritualized nature and naturalness emerg- ing from Romantic thought and employed in and transformed by various national and temporal contexts are multi-faceted and contradictory. We thus now turn our attention to how Asatruers have made use of such widespread ideas to position themselves within mainstream thought, and if and how they share the ambiguous legacy of this tradition. The ‘brown’ roots of ecologism notwithstanding, green ideology today is mostly perceived as leftist. It has been embraced by many a-racist Asatruers in an attempt to distance themselves from right-wing ideologies. Moreover, it has been rejected by ethnicist varieties of Asatru not wanting to be associated with allegedly socialist movements. American ethnicist Asatru also has an ambivalent attitude toward environmental issues, which no doubt stems from the impossibility of arguing for the rootedness of Norse gods and culture in the American landscape. Odinism and ethnicist Asatru have thus had a tendency to stress the ‘blood’ component of nature religion, arguing for Fetishism,” in Knut Hamsun. Transgression and Worlding, ed. Ståle Dingstad, et al., Acta Nordica. Studier i språk- og litteraturvitenskap (Trondheim: Tapir Press, 2011)). However, it is not relevant for my argument about its reception in deep ecology. 105 In this context it is interesting to note, that the German Heimat-film continued the confla- tion of Alpine and Nordic landscape, costume, and custom in order to re-create the abovementioned sentiment of an Arcadian world removed from modern civilization and the war-ravaged cities of the era. The popular German film, Und ewig singen die Wälder (Eternally Sing the Woods), which was loosely based on Norwegian author Tryggve Gulbransson’s novels, is a case in point. It was shot in Norwegian as well as Austrian loca- tions, and was quite obviously used to entice the budding post-war tourism to Norway (cf. “Und ewig singen die Wälder. Trygve Gulbranssens Blut-und-Boden-Trilogie”). <UN> Asatru 209 the ‘natural’ expansionism of Nordic peoples. Nevertheless, within radical Odinism, there is considerable support for eco-terrorists, such as the Una- bomber.106 Asatru circles oriented toward the ethno-pluralism of the New Right, especially those around the ‘radical traditionalist’ journal Tyr, praise environmentalism as “the only high-profile ‘mainstream’ contempo- rary school of thought that might plausibly be termed anti-modern.”107 It is “interested in ‘living in place’ in an organic, homogeneous human commu- nity, as well as in an organic, regional ecosystem.” From here, they derive the social ideal of “natural social hierarchy”108 that they find most clearly devel- oped in bio-regionalism. Two of the strands of the ecology movement, deep ecology and bio- regionalism, strongly promote spiritual aspects of ecologism and are affiliated with Neopaganism.109 Both promote a non-anthropocentric worldview similar to that of Ernst Haeckel’s monism, in which humans are seen as merely a part of nature, and which aims at rescinding the separation of humans and nature by subjugating all beings to nature’s laws. Deep ecology tends to speak of ‘nature’ and ‘the earth’ in a more global fashion, and thus appeals to universal- ist spiritual movements such as the New Age movement. Asatruers and other ‘reconstructionist’ Neopagans consider bio-regionalism the more attractive of the two radical ecological currents, because it places more emphasis on cul- tural specificity. Bio-regionalism originates in an anarchist model of ecological and cultural sustainability. It promotes decentralized political structures based on a network of small regions defined by the ecosystems they are embedded in and independence from arbitrary political borders. It is a holistic concept reminiscent of Herderian ideals, positing an organic unity between nature, landscape, culture, economy, aesthetics, and spirituality. This unity serves as the foundation for a renewed sense of space, belonging, and community.110 Bio-regionalism’s main theorist, Kirkpatrick Sale, recommends basing the arts and spirituality, which he deems indispensable for the creation of deep-rooted bio-regions, on the mythologies of archaic societies, such as the Greek, the 106 Cf. Gardell, Gods of the Blood, 312f. 107 Joshua Buckley, Collin Cleary, and Michael Moynihan, “Editorial Preface,” Tyr. Myth – Culture – Tradition 1 (2002), 8. 108 Ibid., 9. 109 A third one is ecofeminism, which will be discussed in chapter 7. 110 Cf.

Gene Frankland (London etc.: Routledge, 2002); Bernd Hamm and Barbara Rasche, Bioregionalismus.

It tends to naturalize spiritual ‘roots’ as well as social systems as integral parts of bioregions, and thus has parallels to ethno-pluralistic models, which may suggest that “truly autonomous biore- gions will very likely develop highly disparate political systems, some of which may not be democratic.”112 In view of the ideological affinities between right-wing, ethno-pluralist thought and bio-regionalism, it comes as no surprise that parts of the post- war green-brown networks, as well as Asatruers and other reconstructivist Neopagans in Germany, would promote bio-regionalism as a spiritual ecologi- cal alternative.113 In an attempt to regionalize theories imported from the usa and England, and to recover their ‘own’ bioregional traditions, the small German environmental party Unabhängige Ökologen Deutschlands (uöd, Independent Ecologists of Germany),114 a splinter organization from the con- servative environmentalist Ökologische Demokratische Partei (ödp, Ecological Democratic Party), started reverting to theorists of the German Heimatschutz movement, such as Wihelm Heinrich Riehl, Ernst Rudorff, and Ludwig Klages. A leading member of the uöd was Leif-Thorsten Kramps, an Asatruer affiliated with the Germanische Glaubensgemeinschaft and activist of the New Right.115 He established a bio-regionalist working group, the Arbeitskreis Bioregionalismus 111 Kirkpatrick Sale, Dwellers on the Land. The Bioregional Vision (San Francisco: Secker and Warberg, 1985), 3–5. 112 White, “Bioregionalism,” cf. Sale, Dwellers on the Land. 113 The initiative of bringing bio-regionalism to Germany and Austria goes back to a series of books and articles by Eduard Gugenberger and Roman Schweidlenka, two environmental and native spirituality activists. The authors had previously distinguished themselves with critical publications on right-wing esotericist currents within Neopaganism and New Age, while searching for an earth-friendly spirituality they now thought to have found in the American theories of bio-regionalism, cf. Eduard Gugenberger and Roman Schweidlenka, Bioregionalismus. Bewegung für das 21. Jahrhundert (Osnabrück: Packpapier Verlag, 1995). 114 The uöd established itself as the official branch of bio-regionalism in Germany and joined bio-regionalism’s international umbrella organization Planet Drum Foundation (founded in San Francisco in 1973) in 1996, cf. Hamm and Rasche, Bioregionalismus, 26. 115 Biographical information about Kramps was posted on the old homepage of the ak Bio- regionalismus Sauerland which was still accessible in 2009: http://www.bioregionalismus .online.ms/ (printed July 07, 2009). The page currently only provides information about the dissolution of the ak (last accessed November 24, 2011).

The eclectic list of ‘inspirators’ listed leading German Faithlers and Asatruers Ludwig Fahrenkrog, Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson, and Géza von Neményi, together with Heimatschutz protagonist Paul Schultze- Naumburg, eco-anarchists Gustav Landauer and Paul Robien, and New Right theoreticians Alain de Benoist and Henning Eichberg. The fact that this web- page also provided a copy of the eco-terrorist Unabomber Manifesto points to the apocalyptic dimension of Kramps’ philosophy as well as to his openness to violence in furthering bio-regionalist aims. As is the case with the American journal Tyr, in German Asatru contexts, bio-regionalism is most enthusiastically promoted by the circle around Tyr’s German equivalent, the Heidnisches Jahrbuch. Both of its editors, Holger Kliemannel and Daniel Junker, have long been promoting bio-regionalist ideals. Further, Kliemannel collaborated with Kramps on an alternative Pagan journal, Stachelbeere (Gooseberry), for a number of years. However, such engagements have brought to light underlying ideological differences within this network of Neopagan bio-regionalism as well. The anti-racist Neopagan network Der Steinkreis stopped distributing Die Stachelbeere once the ethno-pluralist predilections of Kramps were revealed. Furthermore, allegations of Kramps’ “eco-fascism” contributed to the demise of his Arbeitskreis Bioregionalismus.116 Aside from bio-regionalism, ‘geomancy,’ another related blend of Heimat- schutz and völkisch racial esotericist ecologism, has caught the attention of Asatru circles gathering around the journals Tyr and Heidnisches Jahrbuch as well as the Scandinavian online journal Kulturorgan Skadinaujo.117 In Germany, the Arbeitskreis Bioregionalismus he listed the ggg, the Heidnische Gemeinschaft, the Odinic Rite, and the wcer as recommended links. 116 In an article which settled accounts with such “fascistoid” tendencies, Kliemannel’s mul- ticulturalism was explicitly distinguished from such “brown” tendencies: Theo, “‘außen grün, innen braun, und zu allen Seiten offen?’ Was ist los mit der ‘Stachelbeere’?,” SteinKreis 31 (200), 46f.

Didrik Söderlind, “Diabolos in Musica. Om sort metall og et heller dystert livssyn,” Humanist 3 (2008)). It promotes a similar blend of environmentalism, ethno-pluralism and geomancy, aligning nature protection with the protection of a native cultural and spiritual heritage in much the same way as the völkisch Heimatschutz.

He sees his ideal of a spiritually sustained nature protection realized in geomancy, which for him is an alternative to scientific reductionist views of nature as well as a means to “overcome the basic illnesses of traditional occidental esotericism.”120 Geomancy is an esoteric theory derived from Western occultist speculations about correspondences between microcosm and macrocosm. Intersecting with environmental theories of Gaia, it is based on the idea that the Earth is a living organism, whose energy or power points (an equivalent to chakras) are connected by energy lines. Speculations that such “ley-lines” align the main holy sites of antiquity were first developed by British author Alfred Watkins in 1921.121 It provided inspiration for German völkisch lay scholar Wilhelm Teudt, who saw the Externsteine as an ancient power point used by the Germanic tikler.tpl&cntnt01dateformat=%25e.%25m.%25Y&cntnt01returnid=56, last accessed November 24, 2011 for a positive review of a book on geomancy and “Sarkofagsteinen i Externstein,” KultOrg (KulturOrgan Skadinaujo, web page), http://www.kultorg.com/ index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=213&cntnt01origid=58&cntnt01 detailtemplate=artikler.tpl&cntnt01returnid=56, last accessed November 24, 2011 for an article on Externsteine. 118 Cf. chapter 5. 119 The term “landscape racism” was coined by Gerhard Hard, “‘Hagia Chora.’ Von einem neuerdings wieder erhobenen geomantischen Ton in der Geographie,” Erdkunde. Archiv für wissenschaftliche Geographie 55, no. 2 (2001),178, and refers to a philosophy which assigns an absolute, fateful and lasting influence of a landscape on humans, nations (Volk) or races. Hard traces this figure of thought directly back to völkisch ideology. 120 “Überwindung der Grundkrankheiten der bisherigen abendländischen Esoterik,” Reinhard Falter, Natur neu denken. Erfahrung, Bedeutung, Sinn (Klein Jasedow: Drachen Verlag, 2003), 98, cf. Linse, “‘Fundamentalistischer’ Heimatschutz. Die ‘Naturphilosophie’ Reinhard Falters,” 169. Together with Jochen Kirchhoff, a “radical deep ecologist,” self- appointed “redeemer” of National Socialism’s “shadow,” Falter is active in the German association for geomancy, Hagia Chora, and a regular contributor to its journal (http:// www.geomantie.net/authors/925/view.html, last accessed January 19, 2015). In 1990, a book on “Nietzsche, Hitler, and the Germans” by Kirchhoff sparked discussions on a new eco-fascism. The book’s subtitle was: “The Perversion of the New Age. The Unredeemed Shadow of National Socialism,” Jochen Kirchhoff, Nietzsche, Hitler und die Deutschen. Die Perversion des neuen Zeitalters. Vom unerlösten Schatten des Dritten Reiches (Berlin: Edition Dionysos, 1990). 121 Cf. Harvey, Listening People, Speaking Earth, 147–150, for a discussion of geomancy as a branch of “sacred geographies.” <UN> Asatru 213 tribes because of its exceptional earth energy.122 The ley-line theory enjoyed a surge in popularity in the 1960s and 70s, in the wake of the hippie and other alternative movements.123 It was picked up by Nigel Pennick, known in Asatru circles as an author of popular works on runes and Paganism.124 Pennick has been promoting the ‘experiential science’ of geomancy since the 1960s. His Institute of Geomantic Research “also translated the works of neglected German geomantic writers of the 1930s and 40s.”125 Pennick has recently contributed several articles to the journal Tyr, and his homepage links to the German Hagia Chora. Through the activities of Pennick and others, geomancy’s blend of the belief in ‘earth power,’ astronomy, and rune occultism has become one of the areas in which a German lay science, closely connected to the German Faith Movement and rune occultism of the early 20th century, was spread to a broader public, including sections of the environmental movement. We can conclude that there is a network of groups, individuals and ideas that combine deep ecological engagement, ideas about the sacredness of earth and landscape, and an interest in Asatru with ethno-pluralist ideas, and the “cultural” and “landscape racisms”126 found in New Right circles. It is in these circles that older ideas of German Heimatschutz, and especially its connec- tions with the early German Faith Movement, have been revived. As the rejec- tion of Kramps’ theories within the a-racist Pagan group Steinkreis in Germany has shown, such obviously ethno-pluralist, anti-democratic, racist readings of an ecological spirituality within Asatru are also controversial. Henrik Hallgren, the chair of sas/sfs and one of the most outspoken and differentiated promoters of an ecological spirituality within Asatru, elicits fur- ther critical thought. In his recent book, titled “Det gröna skiftet” (The Green 122 For a further discussion of Teudt and the Externsteine see chapter 7 and 8. 123 Paul Devereux aligned it with neo-shamanism and considered the shaman’s interaction with the land to be guided by such ley-lines and their intersections at megalithic sites, cf. Harvey, Listening People, Speaking Earth, 150. 124 For example Nigel Pennick, Rune Magic (London: The Aquarian Press, 1992), Nigel Pennick and Prudence Jones, A History of Pagan Europe (London/New York: Routledge Chapman & Hall, 1995). 125 http://www.nigelpennick.com/pb/wp_d04f1c1c/wp_d04f1c1c.html.

Die Lehre von den Erdkräften und Erdstrahlen (Waldeck: Felicitas Hübner Verlag, 1987), 58, 69f, 123. 126 Cf. footnote 119. <UN> 214 chapter 6 Change, 2009),127 he leaves no doubt that his environmental goals can and should exclusively be achieved by democratic means. He directs stern criticism against the potential xenophobia inherent in the static conception of culture, place, and belonging bio-regionalism promotes, as well as against its strong emphasis on cultural diversity at the cost of democratic ideals.128 Nevertheless, the Romantic idea of a sacred landscape in which nature, myth, and culture are embedded and mutually constitutive, and where spiritual forces are at work, remains an important aspect of ecologically minded Asatru. Hallgren calls for a re-mythologization of the world as a means of facilitating a shift of consciousness. Myth, as “the language of the soul,”129 forms a gateway between human consciousness and landscape. With the concept of chora as a holistic, experiential space set against the reductive topos of industrialism, he invokes similar categories as Falter and other geomancers, just as he does when he promotes reviving indigenous myths as a spiritual alternative to both atheism and the “monotheistic religions, which often have a tendency to deny nature.”130 In England, ideas of a deified, animated nature and landscape (which includes ancient heritage sites) have motivated activism among English Pagans of all persuasions in recent years. For many of them, the protection of local landscape and remnants of the past has become an important facet of their religion.131 The examples show that neither environmental engagement nor its rejec- tion within modern Asatru can be assigned to a specific political camp. We can, however, contend that spiritual environmentalism can cause troubling blind spots in the assessment of environmental measures within Paganism in general, and Asatru in particular.132 Heathenism, as well as parts of the 127 Hallgren, Det gröna skiftet. 128 Ibid., 123. 129 Ibid., 233. 130 Ibid., 236: “ofta mer naturförnekande monoteistiska religioner.” Cf. 223–236. 131 Cf. Blain and Wallis, Sacred Sites – Contested Rites/Rights; Blain, “Heathenry, the Past, and Sacred Sites in Today’s Britain.” 132 A case in point is Graham Harvey, who, as has been mentioned, now embraces bio- regional animism. In his discussion of Asatru, he mentions Olgar Trust’s activities and the attempts at self-sufficiency pursued by Hammarens Ordens Sällskap (The Society of the Order of the Hammer) in one paragraph. What he completely fails to mention is that the groups have very different political goals: Hammarens Ordens Sällskap “considers multiculturalism and homosexuality to be the cause of confusion and problems, and seek an end to immigration since they believe that people’s identity derives from the land,” Jo Pearson, “Nature Religion,” in Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements, ed. Peter B. Clarke (London/New York: Routledge, 2006), 393. <UN> Asatru 215 eco-spiritual movements that it relates to, perpetuates older ideas about a more ‘natural’ Germanic religion, also in its alleged opposition to Judeo- Christian or monotheist ‘anti-natural’ religion. At times, contradictory con- cepts of nature within these ideological traditions are overlooked, so that the ‘blood’ and ‘soil’ strands become conflated. This makes the varieties of nature spirituality that promote a return to ‘indigenous’ mythic traditions more vul- nerable to racial thought. The example of Asatru as a nature religion is thus one prominent area in which Heathenism transposes residues of older völkisch ideas about Germanic myth and culture into our time, and often into quite varied political contexts. This is facilitated through the widespread use of the same terminology, in this case ‘nature religion’ or ‘nature spirituality,’ which spans a broad range of meanings, from the pure enjoyment of the outdoors or a well-reflected, spiritually based environmentalism, to ethno-pluralist bio- regionalist ideas of separation and purification, or even to the celebration of the ‘natural’ superiority of the Indo-European or Germanic race. <UN>
